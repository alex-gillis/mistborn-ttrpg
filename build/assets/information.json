It does let a character see further through the mists, and more clearly than any ordinary human, even in dim light. So long as the character has at least a little ambient illumination — generally, anywhere but underground, in a sealed room, or in a dense forest on a cloudy night — he or she can see as well as an ordinary person during the day. \n\n Because all senses are enhanced equally, a character burning or flaring Tin is vulnerable to loud noises, sudden bright lights, and extremely strong smells.

                "lore": "A Misting who can burn Iron is called a Lurcher. \n\n Burning Iron lets an Allomancer physically Pull on metals within several dozen yards. While burning Iron, a character sees bright, transparent blue lines leading from his or her center of mass and leading out to all sources of metal within range; the further away an object is from the character, the fainter the blue lines. The character may Pull on any metal objects sensed in this fashion, and this process is commonly called “Ironpulling.” By varying the strength and speed of an Ironpull, a character may affect objects of various sizes, and also control their velocity. A skilled Pull can drag a coin slowly across a surface or hurl a metal urn at speeds approaching that of an arrow.\n\n There are several limitations to this ability. First, objects are Pulled directly towards the character’s center of mass, which is good when drawing a weapon to hand but not as helpful when others are blocking the character’s line of sight to it. Strategic Pullers might use this to their advantage, Pulling a weapon (or another object) that’s situated on the other side of an opponent, turning it into a ranged weapon. This is great until the character misses, at which point he or she becomes a target of the very same missile. Many Ironpullers carry wooden shields for this very reason. \n\n Additionally, the weight an Allomancer can move using Iron depends upon his or her own — Pulling an object that weighs as much as the character results in a pointless tug of war, while Pulling something heavier, or something anchored down in some fashion that would support the character’s weight, moves the character toward the object instead. Thus, Pulling the lock of a sturdy door would draw the character toward the door, unless the surrounding wall were somehow unstable enough that it wouldn’t support the character’s weight. \n\n Allomancers often anchor themselves by Pulling on a second larger object, or increasing their weight. Creative characters use this to maneuver, Pulling themselves up toward anchored objects and using others to guide their trajectories through the air. Careful “Pulling” can even work like relaxing a muscle, letting the character slowly drop from a metal fixture at the top of a high structure or sliding down a steep incline topped with an anchored metal object. Burning Iron can even let a character hover in midair below a sufficiently secured mooring, like a metal chain holding up a large chandelier, or the metal binding around a wooden rafter. \n\n One last restriction: virtually no Allomancer can Pull on metal that’s inside a person, or that’s driven through a body, like metal earrings or Hemalurgic spikes. The only exceptions are through Allomantic enhancements, as provided by Duralumin or Nicrosil",
                "rules": "While burning Iron, you automatically detect and may Pull either one or all metal objects within 100 paces (Medium Range). This distinction is important — you may not choose to Pull more than one object unless you Pull all of them, or you have the Multiple Targets Stunt (see page 306).\n\nIf a Pulled object is smaller or lighter than you, it’s drawn toward you; otherwise, you’re Pulled towards it. In both cases you can control velocity, up to a maximum speed of approximately 100 mph. Generally, Ironpulling requires no roll unless there’s a compelling reason the story might be enhanced with failure (the Narrator always makes this call, as he or she has the best view of all story implications). When a roll is required, it’s made with your Iron rating. \n\nA common use of Ironpulling is to attack with loose metal objects behind an enemy. When you make such an attack, you roll with your Iron rating and apply the other rules listed here: \n\n Pulling an object held or worn by another character is a Contest between your Iron and the target’s Physique. Battling for a metal object with another Allomancer is also a Contest, pitting your Iron vs. his or her Iron. In both cases, success drags the object away from the target (if it’s held) or sends the target sprawling (if the object is worn) ",

For every two charges being stored, you gain one die with Physique rolls to jump or climb, and damage from falling drops by 1 (i.e. when storing four charges of weight, you gain two dice with these rolls and suffer 2 less damage from falls). However, other characters gain the same number of dice when attempting to grapple or throw you, or for any other activity that pits their weight against yours.\n\nYou may only store your own weight in an ironmind; the weight of any objects you carry or wear may never be stored, and in fact if their combined weight is ever greater than yours, you become pinned and may not move.",

                "lore": "A Misting who can burn Steel is called a Coinshot. \n\n Burning Steel grants abilities very similar to those of Iron, with one key difference — the metal lets an Allomancer Push metal within several dozen yards directly away, rather than Pulling them in. This process is typically called “Steelpushing.” A character burning Steel also sees transparent blue lines leading from his center of mass out to every piece of metal within range, and their intensity is likewise based on their distance and size. Pushing along these lines lets the character send an unanchored object of equal or smaller weight away, or sends him or her in the other direction from an anchored or larger object. Allomancers often use this ability to fire small objects like coins at targets (hence the Misting nickname). This makes Steel the most popular form of offensive Allomancy, and puts Coinshots in high demand among noble houses and military forces alike. \n\n Pushing against anchored or larger metal objects (or smaller objects on the ground directly below the character) is a favorite mode of Allomantic travel. By dropping a coin or two on the ground and Pushing against them, a skilled Allomancer can “walk” on stilts of Allomantic force, or hover dozens of yards in the air. In the early days of the Final Empire, Allomantic highways were comprised of metal bars wedged into the ground, providing Allomancers with quick and reliable travel between Luthadel and other major cities. Of course, landing can be difficult, so many leave such stunts to Mistborn (who can absorb the punishment of any mishap with Pewter). \n\n As with Iron, Pushing on metal inside or piercing the body of another living being (like piercings and Hemalurgic spikes) is exceedingly difficult, and typically only achievable when also using an enhancement metal like Duralumin or Nicrosil. ",
                "rules": "While burning Steel, you automatically detect and may Push either one or all metal objects within 100 paces (Medium Range). This distinction is important — you may not choose to Push more than one object unless you Push all of them, or you have the Multiple Targets Stunt. \n\n If a Pushed object is smaller or lighter than you, it’s propelled away from you; otherwise, you’re Pushed away from it. In both cases you can control velocity, up to a maximum speed of approximately 100 mph. Generally, Steelpushing requires no roll unless there’s a compelling reason the story might be enhanced with failure (the Narrator always makes this call, as he or she has the best view of all story implications). When a roll is required, it’s made with your Steel rating. \n\n A common use of Steelpushing is to attack with loose metal objects between you and an enemy (e.g. the contents of a coin purse or a bag of horseshoes, which you can throw at an opponent as part of an attack). When you make such an attack, you roll with your Steel rating and apply the other rules listed below.\n\n Pushing an object held or worn by another character is a Contest between your Steel and the target’s Physique. Battling for a metal object with another Allomancer is also a Contest, pitting your Steel vs. his or her Steel. In both cases, success propels the object out of the target’s hands and away from you (if it’s held) or sends the target sprawling (if the object is worn). In the case of a metal object positioned between two Steelpushing Allomancers, the object can become a projectile targeting the loser, using the rules on the Steelpushing Attacks table. \n\n Finally, by Pushing off of metal in your environment, or metallic implements on the ground like coins or horseshoes, you may hover in midair, or “stilt-walk” or sail at up to 25 miles per hour. This is not flight, and the maximum height you can reach is equal to your Pushing range (100 paces, unless you have the Long Range Stunt). Landing can also be problematic, requiring you to Push off of metal objects thrown down onto the ground or already located there. Most landings require no roll but doing so in rough or treacherous terrain requires a successful Steel 1 roll, with failure costing you 1 Health.",

As soon as the character starts burning Copper, all signs of Allomancy within the cloud’s range instantly “vanish” from Bronze burners — including any Bronze burners in the same area. This makes a Copper burner an essential addition to any crew employing Allomancers — without concealing the pulses every Allomancer gives off while burning metal, the team is easily detected by rival Seekers, Mistborn, and Steel Inquisitors. \n\n A second useful effect of burning Copper is that it renders the character virtually immune to Allomantic emotional manipulation.

This of course makes them a vital commodity in the information-starved Final Empire. \n\n While storing memorized knowledge or events, a character has only a faint recollection of them — much like a fading dream. This is often done to keep information “fresh, committing a memory to a coppermind as soon as it’s no longer immediately useful as possible, so it can be retrieved later without having to rely on the tenuous nature of the mind. Cagey characters sometimes store damaging secrets as well — because what need is there to lie when you genuinely can’t remember something? \n\n Tapping memories lets a Feruchemist “check out” that information, like someone in our world would check out a library book. He or she recalls it precisely and with perfect clarity, as if via photographic memory, and can describe it without issue. For example, a character recalling a book could duplicate it exactly, word for word. However, this process does not improve the accuracy of the information recalled — a character who was mistaken about a person’s name still remembers it incorrectly, and because the memory is stored in a perfect and unaltered (and unalterable) the character’s impression never changes, even after countless corrections from trusted friends. \n\n The massive wealth of information stored can be difficult to track, and so many Feruchemists organize memories into different copperminds and keep detailed indices of what’s contained in each. Others reread books they’ve stored and write down rough details of their stored knowledge to use as reference when tapping their copperminds. In many ways this reinforces the library analogy, as the cracks in the system aren’t so much about the recorded information as one’s access and perception of it. \n\n The greatest peril for a Feruchemist is that one or more copperminds are lost or destroyed, as this means the memories held within are gone for good. For some characters this vulnerability is a blessing, providing an opportunity few can indulge — the chance to selectively and permanently forget painful or troubling memories — but to most it’s a desperate danger. The chance that such a prized possession might disappear forever, denying not only a life’s work but a life’s most personal legacy...

The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Copper rating or your Wits score minus 1, whichever is lower. \n\n Unlike most Feruchemical storage, memory does not reset when the process is complete. Stored memories remain lost until tapped, and only return whiletapped; at all other times those memories are simply gone. They may not be dredged up, even under duress. \n\nThe Narrator always has final say as to what information qualifies for storing in a coppermind.",

Any or all emotions a target is already feeling may be magnified, though Zinc is most often used to amplify only a single emotion that the character feels will best serve his or her cause, like an opponent’s fear during a duel.\n\nAn Allomancer can’t use Zinc to create new feelings in a target, only pull their existing emotions to the fore. Someone who’s bored or annoyed by a performance couldn’t be made to genuinely enjoy the show, but Zinc could ratchet up the restlessness until he or she heckles the performer or walks out.\n\nThus, a character will often seed an emotion before burning Zinc — by offering a strong enough bargain to promote greed, for example, or by appealing to an outraged person’s sense of fair play to promote calm. The stronger the emotion already is, the more effective Zinc can be in fueling its growth.\n\nZinc does not let a character detect emotions, and so burners of the metal are usually practiced students of the human condition. Careful observation and analysis of behavior are vital to successfully manipulating any target’s emotional state.\n\nLikewise, Zinc Allomancy is not mind control — a Rioted emotion is still the target’s own, it’s just more powerful, and no matter how strongly the target feels something he or she is still guided by core principles, preferences, and predilections. As an example, enflaming one person’s anger might prompt them to start a bar brawl, while doing the same in someone else might result in them traded insults, stalking off in disgust, or even finding comfort at the bottom of a bottle.\n\nEmotional Allomancy is a reality of House life, with most nobles (and all Obligators) on the lookout for possible Allomantic manipulation. Sudden, strong, or inappropriate mood shifts are telltale signs and often disregarded out of hand, just in case a Rioter or Soother is the cause. Some Allomancers use this to their advantage, tampering with an emotion they want the target to ignore. Others know the best way to achieve their goals is through subtlety and guile rather than brute force and zeal.",
                "rules": "While burning Zinc, you may amplify one or more existing emotions in a number of individuals up to your rating with the metal. You may only affect those within 10 paces (Close Range).\n\nYou may not use Zinc to detect emotions, but you may roll your Charm to do so. This is a Difficulty 1 Challenge if the target is unaware of your attempt (and therefore unable to conceal their feelings), or a Charm vs. Charm Contest if they’re aware and trying to conceal their state.\n\nYou may Riot any emotion(s) you like, but your efforts are most effective when a target emotion is already strong. Thus, the Difficulty of any Zinc roll to amplify an emotion is based on its current strength. When Rioting multiple emotions, your Difficulty is set by the weakest of them (i.e. you roll against the highest Difficulty of all the target emotions)\n\nWith success, the target emotion(s) swell and you gain one die per point of Outcome with Charm and Influence rolls against the victim, so long as you concentrate your attention on them and keep burning Zinc (see What’s the Outcome?).\n\nWith failure, the target emotion(s) aren’t stirred and the Narrator may spend two Complications to alert the target to your effort. Four Complications may be spent to identify you as the source of the manipulation (see Complications).\n\nRemember that Zinc does not grant you control of a Rioted character — it merely pulls them in one direction or another as befits their personal motivations and impulses. It’s also not always one-sided — a target aware that you’re manipulating them can oppose your Zinc rolls with their Wits or Charm, as fits their approach (in the Narrator’s estimation).\n\nou can also Riot discordant emotions — like pleasure in someone performing an unpleasant task, or guilt after a victory — and this can trip up or confuse the victim. When anyone within range succeeds with a Charm or Influence roll, you may react by rolling your Zinc against a Difficulty equal to his or her Result, and for each point of positive Outcome you score, the victim loses one die with their next action (to a maximum of their Result with the current roll).

It also helps the character recover from serious mental hardships, including Burdens inflicted during a Mental Conflict. \n\nEveryone’s identity is shaped over time by their experiences, and stored identity is no different. Like any Feruchemical transfer, identity is set at the time it’s stored, and tapping it later — especially in large amounts — can “reset” the character’s personality to that earlier version of him or herself. In this way, an altruistic freedom fighter with large amounts of their identity stored prior to becoming a Steel Inquisitor or the willing pawn of a vile crime lord might tap his or her aluminummind to regain lost convictions and once again walk an honorable path.

In this way investiture is the most potent enhancement available in Feruchemy, a reserve of pure, universal power that can amplify nearly any Feruchemical effort. \n\n The promise of Nicrosil becomes even more astounding if you consider it in relation to one of the incredibly powerful sources of power in the Final Empire (such as the Well of Ascension or the mists). Theoretically, a character exposed to one of these might be able to transform and store its seemingly limitless power, putting near-godlike power at his or her disposal.

In this case any gained dice and bonuses to Result and/or Outcome are totaled and halved, rounding down, to determine how much investiture is stored.

As with exploring the consequences of specific divergences, a Gold roll may be required for any of these efforts, with a Difficulty based on the same factors. \n\n Burning Gold is mentally and emotionally taxing as your conscious mind struggles with a torrent of new information and grapples with the fact that none of it is real.

You must also choose the bubble’s area, which can extend outward up to 10 paces (Close Range). \n\n Characters and objects crossing into or out of the time-bubble are jolted by the experience... \n\n - Any living being entering or exiting is momentarily disoriented, losing a Beat (see page 136). \n\n - A physical attack made through the bubble, whether held or thrown, is robbed of its kinetic energy, often with an audible “pop.” This makes these attacks nearly impossible to land, and grants the defender — whether it’s you or someone else — a number of “free dice” equal to your Bendalloy rating with each roll made to defend. \n\n Additionally, characters inside the bubble gain the following benefits. \n\n - Your Bendalloy rating is added to each character’s Wits score for the purpose of declaring actions in a Conflict (see page 172). This does not impact the character’s Wits score under any other circumstances. \n\n -  Each time a character in the bubble takes an action against a character outside it, he or she gains a number of dice with that action equal to your Bendalloy rating. \n\n Should your bubble overlap another Bendalloy bubble, the time differential of the overlapping area is equal to the sum of both. Thus, if a bubble set to one minute outside for every 20 minutes inside overlapped with a bubble set to one minute outside for every 5 minutes inside, 25 minutes would pass in the overlapping area for every one minute in the outside world. \n\n If your bubble overlaps a Cadmium bubble, time is either faster in the overlapping area (if your time differential is higher than that of the Cadmium bubble), or slower (if the Cadmium bubble’s time differential is higher).

            "basics":"Allomancy lets a person ingest one or more metals and “burn” them to fuel various powers. While burning a metal, an Allomancer feels warmth radiating from his stomach, as if he just consumed a hot beverage or strong drink. The power granted depends on the metal burnt, and each metal burns at a different rate, depending on the power’s intensity. \n\n The vast majority of Allomancers are Mistings, who can burn only a single metal. By the last days of the Final Empire, about one in every 100 nobles, and one in every 10,000 skaa, possessed the ability to burn each metal. Rarer still are Mistborn, who comprise about one in every 100 Allomancers (or one in every 10,000 nobles), and who can burn all Allomantic metals. These special individuals are the subjects of great awe and wonder, worshipped and feared for their versatile and deadly gift. \n\n Despite its rarity, Allomancy is by far the most common of the three magic disciplines, and it’s also the only one that’s publicly known and discussed during the Lord Ruler’s thousand-year reign. By his decree, Allomancy is restricted exclusively to the nobility, and even then its use in noble circles is carefully monitored by the Obligators of the Steel Ministry. Skaa Allomancers — typically the result of illegitimate relations between nobles and skaa servants — are forbidden, and aggressively hunted by the Canton of Inquisition, and most notoriously by its elite agents, the Steel Inquisitors. This mortal danger drives many skaa Allomancers to join outlaw crews for protection and support, and many bands of thieves, rebels, and rogue scholars count at least an Allomancer or two amongst their ranks.",
            "history": "Little is known about Allomancy before the Final Empire. Some scholars believe Allomancy existed prior to the Lord Ruler’s Ascension, and that it manifested about as often as today. Others postulate the first Allomancers were the Lord Ruler’s earliest supporters, who were granted power by Lerasium taken from the Well of Ascension. It’s certain the first Allomancers were powerful Mistborn who went on to become the Empire’s first nobles, and that they passed their abilities down through the generations. The power in their blood was gradually weakened by time and interbreeding, however, until it reached the dilution seen in the modern day.\n\nOnly ten Allomantic metals are commonly known — the four physical metals (Tin, Pewter, Iron, and Steel), the four mental metals (Copper, Bronze, Zinc, and Brass), Atium, and Gold. Of these, Atium is by far the rarest and most valuable, making the state-controlled Atium supply a critical element in the finances of the Final Empire. \n\nKnowledge of other metals is either restricted or lost to the public, and the danger of “blindly” burning metals leaves very little room or inventive for experimentation. Indeed, the Steel Ministry strongly discourages experimentation, and it’s not uncommon for “progressive” metallurgists to simply vanish in the dead of night.\n\n After the Lord Ruler’s defeat metallurgists are again free to explore new Allomantic applications, sparking a wave of new discoveries. Knowledge of Aluminum is one of the first discoveries, followed shortly by Duralumin and Electrum, and as light is shed on the darkened archives and the Ministry’s vast troves of information, still other metals and uses are found all the time.",
            "ascension":"The discovery of new metals since the Final Ascension has transformed the practice of Allomancy. The most prominent and important discoveries have been of the temporal metals Bendalloy and Cadmium, which allow an Allomancer to slow or increase the passage of time around him, respectively. Nicrosil and Chromium, which greatly boost or drain Allomantic abilities in a flash, have also changed Scadrial’s magical landscape. \n\n However, no single metal has had a greater impact on modern Allomancy than Aluminum. This metal was thought to be of little use during the Final Empire era, thanks to its limited utility in draining an Allomancer’s stores (since they had to willingly burn it) and the difficulty in producing it. However, the advances in mining and refining technology has made Aluminum vastly easier to find and produce, allowing engineers to discover the metal’s greatest ability — Allomantic neutrality. Objects made from or lined with Aluminum cannot be detected or affected by a Misting’s powers, making Aluminum bullets or Aluminum-lined hats hard counters to the abilities of Coinshots, Lurchers, Rioters, and Soothers. An Aluminum-framed pistol is worth more to a gunslinger than chest full of gold — because who wants to burn Gold? \n\n One metal has been lost in the transition from the old world to the new — Atium. Atium nuggets were the body of the dark god Ruin; with the destruction of Ruin, so too was his body destroyed. Over the centuries, many intrepid adventurers have declared they’ve discovered an atium nugget, or part of the Lord Ruler’s ancient atium cache, but to date every claim has proven to be hogwash. But would Harmony really take something away from the world, when he’s worked to preserve so much? There’s always another secret…",

Some metals, like Tin and Pewter, add the rating to an existing Attribute or Standing, while others, like Steel and Iron, are rolled as pools for various uses and when performing particular tasks.",

They feel a radiating warmth from their stomach when they do this, as if they’d just consumed something hot or spirited. \n\n Burning is effectively instantaneous and doesn’t impact what the character can do during a Beat, even during a Conflict. Burning gradually consumes the character’s reserve of a metal, and so long as that reserve remains the character continues to benefit as described in each metal’s chapter (these begin with Chapter 6: Tin, on page 295). Once the reserve runs out, the character loses access to that power until more of the metal is ingested. \n\n An Allomancer can generally only burn metal while conscious. Characters with more than one Power may burn one, some, or all of their ingested metals, in any combination they wish.",
            "charges": "An Allomancer’s reserve of each metal is measured in “charges.” Most Allomancers refill their metal stores by drinking vials filled with a mixture of metal shavings and an ounce of liquid like water or wine. The metals in these vials depend upon their owner: Misting vials having more shavings of a single metal, while Mistborn vials have a cocktail of all eight Physical and Mental metals, though less of each (see page 237). A typical Allomancer carries several on these vials with him, but they can be lost or destroyed during rough and tumble brawls, or consumed during periods of extended burning. In such times, any sufficiently pure piece of the appropriate metal will suffice. \n\n Here are some examples of the charges an Allomancer may draw from ingesting pure metals: \n\n",

These scores do not rise again until the metal is completely burned off. In the rare event that this drops the character’s Physique to 0, the character falls unconscious and dies in the next several minutes without assistance (a successful Wits 3 roll). \n\n Additionally, any metals also can become poisonous if they linger in an Allomancer’s system too long (whether they’re pure or not). When a charge of metal is not completely burned off within eight hours of ingestion, the Allomancer loses 1 Health per unburned charge from toxic shock. This can drop a character’s Health to 0, in which case he or she falls unconscious and dies in the next several minutes without assistance (a successful Wits 3 roll). \n\n An impure metal cannot be flared",
            "burnrate":"Not all metals burn at the same rate — more potent metals, like Atium or Pewter, tend to burn much more quickly than others like Copper or Tin. A metal’s “burn rate” is the time it takes an Allomancer to fully digest (consume) a single charge. \n\n An Allomancer can boost his potency with a metal Power by “flaring,” which temporarily increases the character’s rating with the metal by 1. This rapidly consumes the character’s charges, however, increasing the metal’s burn rate to 10 times normal (i.e. each charge flares in 1/10 the metal’s normal burn time).

For example, a Soother can quell the emotions of a single target without any special training, but with the Affect Crowd Stunt he or she can calm multiple targets at once. \n\n Stunts are gained by spending Advancements, at a cost of 4 Advancements each (see page 121). Stunts vary by metal, and are described in each metal’s chapter later in the Treatise. An Allomancer may learn any number of Stunts for his or her metals, but each Stunt may only be gained once for each metal, unless otherwise noted in the Stunt’s description. \n\n A character who gains Allomantic Power(s) from a Hemalurgic spike may learn Stunts for those Powers, even though the corresponding ratings may not be improved. Should the character ever lose the spike(s) that grant a Power, however, he or she also loses access to any corresponding Stunts until and unless the same spike is regained. \n\n A few Stunts grant temporary Traits that may be applied to related tasks (see pages 74 and 139), but only while the character is burning or flaring the metal in question. These Stunts are identified with the word “Trait” in parentheses following their names.",
            "savants": "By constantly developing skill with a single metal, highly gifted Mistings can reach the pinnacle of Allomantic power, becoming a “Misting Savant.” The process of awakening as a Savant is demanding: a Misting constantly burns and frequently flares metals through most waking hours. After several months of this, he or she may trigger the change, though the Narrator may always veto it on the grounds that it isn’t supported by the current story or isn’t appropriate for the character. \n\nWith Narrator approval, a Misting with a Power rating of 7+ may spend 10 Advancements to become a Savant, gaining two “free” Nudges with each roll of his or her Power.\n\nSadly, such prolonged exposure to Allomantic forces fundamentally changes the Misting, and many suffer health problems or addiction-like symptoms that are only relieved by using their Power. As a result, most Savants suffer one or more penalties while not burning, as described in each metal chapter.\n\nBecoming a Savant shouldn’t just ‘happen’ because you have a few extra Advancements lying around. The Mistborn Adventure Game is a story- and character-driven system, and your Hero is likely to spend many gaming sessions buying all the metal needed to fuel the process, and many more Breathers burning and flaring it all before he or she is eligible for the change. \n\nIdeally, a Hero should make the decision to become a Savant based on his or her particular motivations — like Tragedy and Destiny. A grand failure feeding the determination to become better with metal, for example, is possibly strong enough, if it makes sense in your game’s story. \n\n I would also suggest tweaking your Hero’s personality a bit as he or she makes the transition. Becoming a Savant isn’t like “leveling up” — your Hero has undergone a life-changing transformation, and that should be represented in demeanor as well as ability.",
            "mistings": "Allomancy has changed significantly since the time of the Final Empire. The Mistborn have faded into the mists of legend, along with the notion that anyone can harness the full spectrum of Allomantic power. Those with Allomantic gifts no longer conceal their abilities from sight, but use their powers openly in everyday life for the betterment of themselves and their world. Publications and tutors teach young Allomancers how to burn metals properly and precisely, and pure metals and alloys are widely available for a reasonable price. Allomancy has created and transformed The Alloy of Law era, with Mistings (and their Twinborn cousins) reaping the benefits.",
            "society":"Allomancy is the most predominant Metallic Art of the modern day. Of all types of magic, Allomancy is the best known and most trusted, mainly because its benefits tend to be both obvious and tangible — anyone can understand that Allomancy can be used to pick up a massive crate, influence a skeptical listener, or launch oneself into the air. \n\n Allomancy is also the most common of the Metallic Arts, with one person in 50 possessing Allomantic abilities. The use of Allomancy is common enough that Mistings are considered just a different type of gifted individual, and their magic is just as special as particularly high intelligence, personal charisma, or technical affinity. Those Mistings of means typically seek formal training in the use of their powers, either by private tutor or through apprenticeship, and many wealthier secondary schools and universities offer formal programs to help young Allomancers get the most from their gifts. \n\n  Many Mistings put their Allomantic powers to work in their careers, whether in labor, business, academia, or politics, and nearly anyone with the metals and the money can find a specialist that meets their needs. On the high steel of the skyscrapers rising inexorably from the Elendel skyline, skilled Lurcher engineers work tirelessly to move supplies and supports into place without worrying about falling to their deaths. When a new mine opens up, Tineye surveyors are the first inside to explore for dangerous terrain, gas leaks, and potential collapse. In the constabulary, Soothers act to quell riots and civil disputes alike, while in industrial shops they find employment as strike-breakers and “workplace satisfaction consultants.” Rioter activists flare emotions of crowds in support of their candidates or causes, while in the criminal underworld they Pull forth feelings of fear, intimidation, and reservation in their employer’s victims. Electrum-burning stock brokers use their metals to predict and capitalize on minute changes in the market. If there’s a place that an Allomancer can make life safer, easier, or more affordable, someone is willing to pay to have a Misting there, burning their metals. \n\n Not all Mistings choose to turn their gifts to a profit — in fact, a fair number of Allomancers choose not to reveal their abilities at all. The reasons these Mistings choose not to do so are myriad. Sometimes hiding a power is simply a matter of personal shame, if for instance one’s power seems inferior or useless. At other times, powers might be concealed to protect a family’s reputation, as when a Misting is born to a family line that does not have any Allomancers. At still others, Mistings hide their powers in order to protect a political or business advantage, such as a Smoker, Rioter, or Soother hidden amongst political staff or a Leecher or Oracle bodyguard. \n\n The choice to conceal Allomantic abilities is entirely personal; there are no laws on the books requiring anyone to disclose whether or not one is metalborn. Nevertheless, the specter of Misting registration remains a never-ending political issue, raised in the guise of upholding “public safety” or the “common good.” In governmental meetings and letters to the newspapers, hypothetical horror stories of Coinshot peeping toms watching through your second-story window, or Pewterarm goons who casually intimidate folk are trotted out as examples of possible Misting threats to Harmony-fearing men and women everywhere. \n\n Though these far-fetched tales rarely play out, those who keep their abilities private sometimes face backlash if and when their Allomantic gifts are revealed, even in the more cosmopolitan communities of Elendel’s academic and well-to-do sets. Friendships may be abandoned; business contracts lost; political alliances dissolved; or access to family resources revoked. Despite the vast steps Mistings have made in gaining acceptance in the world since the times of the Lord Ruler, people still only trust Mistings until they uncover one where they weren’t expecting him."

            "id": 1,
            "name": "Feruchemy",
            "basics": "Feruchemy is a gift of the Terris people, who hail from the northern reaches of the Final Empire. It lets a practitioner, known as a Feruchemist, use certain metals as a storage medium for various traits and capabilities (like strength, speed, or luck). These stores can be released (or “tapped”) at a later time, and often grant explosive or superhuman ability well beyond the limits of Allomancy. For example, tapping speed can make a Feruchemist much faster, while tapping strength can make him vastly strong and tapping luck can make him wildly fortunate. \n\n Objects used to store and tap are called metalminds, and only the Feruchemist who stores a trait or capability in a metalmind can tap it. Also, the process is not quick. Consequently, a Feruchemist must often do without part or even most ability for a significant period of time to build sufficient reserves for the most impressive boosts. For example, a Feruchemist looking for just one burst of increased strength might have to store it for days, all the while being far weaker than usual. The same is true for any ability — storing keen sight might blur the Feruchemist’s vision, storing health might seriously depress his immune system and slow his healing, storing wakefulness might leave him drowsy, and so on. \n\n Feruchemy can potentially offer much greater power than Allomancy, as it lets a character tap stored characteristics much faster than they were stored. Tapping great strength in a single moment could, for example, let a Feruchemist tear open an iron gate with his or her bare hands, just as tapping great sight could render objects crystal clear over vast distances. Unfortunately, these extreme levels of power cannot be maintained for long — traits and capabilities stored over weeks might be exhausted in just a few minutes, or even in a single burst when needed.",
            "history": "By the final days of the Final Empire, knowledge of Feruchemy is all but totally lost — in fact, few outside the Terris Dominance are even aware the discipline exists at all. This is due in large part to a millennium-long suppression campaign by the Lord Ruler and agents of his Steel Ministry, who are charged with wiping out all evidence that Feruchemy ever existed. What little knowledge remains today is found in either the great archives of the Canton of Inquisition or with the Terris Keepers, and it’s closely guarded by both. \n\n Even to those aware of Feruchemy’s existence, its history remains spotty. It’s been part of Terris culture since before the Lord Ruler’s Ascension, though it was once far more common among the Terris people. As the Final Empire was established, most of the world’s most powerful Feruchemists vanished and the Lord Ruler isolated their homeland, crushing their religion and making them second-class citizens. Most heinously, he created a breeding program that enslaved women and gelded men, all with a single, nefarious purpose in mind — wiping Feruchemy from the world. \n\n This savage suppression has drastically diminished the number of Feruchemists in Scadrial, but it’s also given rise to a new and vital faction — the Keepers of the Terris Synod. Based on the Terris Worldbringers who lived before the Lord Ruler’s ascension, the Keepers are a secret sect of Feruchemists trained both in the use of their powers and with the intense study of a single subject like history, religion, or politics. They’re charged with quietly watching and recording the changing world, and keeping its knowledge safe for the future, usually in Feruchemical copperminds. The Keepers prepare this knowledge to pass on when the Lord Ruler eventually falls, and in the wake of his defeat it’s they who drag the Terris culture back from the brink of annihilation.",
            "ascension": "Much like Terris culture, Feruchemy is in the midst of a golden age. Ferrings are nearly as numerous as Allomancers; while this doesn’t make them common by any stretch of the imagination, it does mean the Terris legacy of Feruchemy, and the blood that carries it, is more well-known and accepted than ever before. \n\n The discovery of new Allomantic metals has affected the landscape of Feruchemy as well. Foremost of these are what Ferrings refer to as the Spiritual Metals (known as the Enhancement Metals in Allomancy) — Aluminum, Duralumin, Chromium, and Nicrosil. Unknown and unused by Feruchemists during the Lord Ruler’s reign, the abilities these metals offer are astounding — the ability to store and tap identity, connection to others, luck, and investiture…raw magical energy. Feruchemical scholars are still exploring the applications and consequences of these abilities, and many more brash young Ferrings are experimenting and exploiting them in the field. ",
            "mechanical": "Unlike Allomancers, Feruchemists don’t gain charges by consuming metals; rather, they store charges in metal objects called metalminds, which can be rings, bracers, earrings, or even larger pieces of metal in the game world, like pillars, natural nodes, or thrones. These charges can later be tapped, in small increments that last longer or in massive bursts that allow for superhuman feats. In this sense Feruchemy is a “closed loop;” while it potentially lets a Feruchemist achieve things an Allomancer never could, it often requires weeks, months, or even years to store up that much power. \n\n A Feruchemist must be in direct contact with a metalmind to store charges in it, or to tap those charges. For this reason many metalminds are jewelry, but any metal object of sufficient purity will work. Each metal stores only one characteristic or ability, as noted in the metal chapters later in this Book. \n\n A Feruchemist may only ever use his own metalminds, as the characteristics and abilities he stores and taps must be his own. Storing and tapping are willful acts, and may only be performed while the Feruchemist is conscious.\n\nAs with Allomancy, a character’s Feruchemical Power with each metal is rated from 1 to 10, which represents his storing and tapping ability with corresponding metalminds (1 being barely competent and 10 being incredibly skilled). This rating determines the rate at which the Feruchemist can store in and tap from corresponding metalminds:\n\n - Storing: The maximum number of charges a Feruchemist may store in a metalmind per hour is equal to his rating with that metal. The maximum number of charges a Feruchemist may store is determined by the size of his or her metalmind.\n\n - Tapping: The maximum number of charges a Feruchemist may tap from a metalmind per action is equal to his rating × 10 with that metal.\n\n We recommend tracking the charges in each Hero’s metalminds on separate lines of his or her character sheet for ease of reference.",

            "startRate": "You’ll find that a character with Powers from the outset (i.e. one who commits a strength, as mentioned in the first bullet above) is typically more powerful than one who gains  Powers later. This is thanks to the training and practice he or she has already had before the start of the story.",
            "spendAdv": "A Feruchemist may spend Advancements to increase his or her rating with each metal (see page 123). Note however that there are no Stunts for Feruchemists, and that while a character may gain one or more Feruchemical Powers from Hemalurgic spikes, he or she can never improve those Powers’ ratings", 
            "storing": "To store characteristics or abilities, a Feruchemist must be conscious and in direct contact with a metalmind composed of the appropriate metal and purity. Again, the Feruchemist’s ability with whatever he or she stores is weakened until the storing process is complete, and the more the Feruchemist stores in an hour the weaker he or she is during that time. \n\n Most of the time storing is detrimental — the Feruchemist becomes weaker, sickly, near-sighted, amnesiac, and so on — but in some rare cases it can be beneficial (like storing weight when falling or balancing on a rickety rope bridge). \n\n While storing charges, a Feruchemist is affected as described in the corresponding metal’s chapter. A Feruchemist may store any number of characteristics and abilities at a time, so long as he or she has the appropriate metalminds, but no characteristic or ability may be reduced to nothing as a result of storing. The specific limits for this are also described in each metal’s chapter, as each is a little different. \n\n For each full hour a Feruchemist spends storing, a number of charges are added to the metalmind equal to the character’s rating with that metal, or up to the limit described in each metal’s chapter, whichever is lower. Only full hours spent storing are counted, and if the Feruchemist is halted or interrupted for any reason, no charges are gained. This means that a Feruchemist can’t, for example, stop storing for the duration of a fight and then return to the process). He or she can, however, change from hour to hour if desired. \n\n Scores reduced while storing can severely impact a character’s chance of success with associated tasks and greatly magnify the cost of failure. \n\n Remember to roleplay this. A Feruchemist storing attributes should act, play, and interact differently than one who isn’t. Storing isn’t just a procedure disconnected from the person, but a fundamental change in who they are. When portraying this in the game, pull back a bit and ask yourself what an entirely different character with the altered score(s) might be like, and apply the answer(s) in your descriptions.",
            "breathers": "Breathers are “off screen” time when actions and events are largely glossed over so everyone can skip forward to the next moment that’s important to the story. Breathers often cover routine or mundane tasks — the stuff you don’t want to waste real world time roleplaying — and so Feruchemists can’t devote them entirely to storing. \n\n The maximum charges a Feruchemist may store depend on the length of the Breather: \n\n Short Breather: The maximum number of charges a Feruchemist may store in a Short Breather is equal to 10 × his or her normal maximum, as described in the previous section. \n\n Long Breather: The maximum number of charges a Feruchemist may store in a Long Breather is equal to 30 × his or her normal maximum, as described in the previous section. \n\n This is true no matter how much time the Breather actually represents in the game world. It keeps the game simple and balanced, and ensures no one abuses the system with arguments of “reality.”",
            "capacity": "The maximum number of charges a metalmind can store depends on its physical size. Unless otherwise cleared with the Narrator and supported by strong story, a typical metalmind — one gained as a Prop — is of “average” size, and can therefore store up to 100 charges.",

                }
            ],
            "tapping": "To tap previously stored characteristics or abilities, a Feruchemist must be conscious and in direct contact with the metalmind he or she wishes to tap (again, a Feruchemist may only store in and tap his own metalminds, never anyone else’s). As while storing, a Feruchemist undergoes noticeable changes when tapping. For example, a Feruchemist tapping strength may grow more muscular, and one tapping sight may gain tunnel vision and possibly vertigo. The more charges are tapped at once, the more noticeable these changes become. \n\n A Feruchemist may choose to tap anytime he or she takes an action or makes a roll. When a single action involves multiple rolls, the Feruchemist must tap independently for each roll — he or she cannot tap once when dragging a large object, for example, and gain the benefits for each roll made to drag the object part of the distance. Nor can a Feruchemist tap once and gain the benefits for all rolls made in an Extended Contest. \n\n The maximum number of stored charges that may be tapped for each action or roll is equal to 10 × the Feruchemist’s rating with that metal. A Feruchemist may tap any number of metalminds at a time, though only one of each metal for any action or roll. Tapped charges are immediately consumed, even if the current action or roll fails. \n\nTapping can dramatically increase the size of a dice pool, granting extra Nudges if it rises over 10 dice",
            "tenMore": "A Feruchemist can also tap ten or more charges at once for a spectacular effect. For example, tapping ten or more charges of Pewter (strength) might let a Feruchemist dead-lift a horse, knock over a loaded wagon, or even tear a castle gate from its hinges! \n\n For every 10 charges tapped, the Outcome of the Feruchemist’s action or roll improves by 1 (to a maximum Outcome of 6). Charges tapped in this fashion do not also grant the other effects listed for the metal (like adding dice for certain rolls), and the player must always declare that he or she is tapping 10 or more charges before any roll is made or any Outcome is described.",
            "nudge": "Finally, a Feruchemist may tap charges to increase the speed, accuracy, or effectiveness of his efforts. \n\n By tapping 5 charges, the Feruchemist may add 1 Nudge to a related action or roll. As with tapping 10 or more charges at once, the player must declare that he or she is using this option before any roll is made or any Outcome is described. \n\n When tapping 5 charges, a character does not gain any other effects listed for the metal. \n\n Remember that storing can be as useful as tapping. It’s second nature for many Feruchemists, for example, to store hearing when confronted with a loud noise (though the Narrator may sometimes ask for a Wits or other roll to do so, especially if the noise is a surprise). Likewise, storing weight makes you lighter, which can be tremendously helpful in a fall. \n\n In most cases, the utility of storing is narrower than tapping, but a clever Feruchemist always keeps an eye out for ways to use both to his or her advantage",
            "ferrings":"During the World of Ash, the only Feruchemists were the secretive Keepers, who could use all of the Feruchemical metals. In this dark era, brave and dedicated Terris found methods to subvert the Lord Ruler’s brutal breeding program in ways that allowed them to make certain that Keeper bloodlines continued and were kept pure. However, all of that ended with the Lord Ruler’s death. \n\n In the post-Origin world, Terrisfolk (and by extension, Feruchemists) were allowed to once again mingle, marry, and have children with whomever they chose, and in so doing, spread the Feruchemical bloodlines into the general population. As the power spread, so did it dilute, leading to Feruchemists who could only store or tap a single ability: Ferrings (as well as the rise of Twinborn, who can use a single Allomantic and Feruchemical power).",
            "society":"By the time of The Alloy of Law, a majority of people have at least trace amounts of Terris ancestry and potential to become Ferrings. Overall, about one person in 50 develops Feruchemical abilities, but that number rises sharply among people with significant Terris ancestry, particularly the Terris communities of the Basin and the enclaves of the mountains. \n\n Like Allomancy, Feruchemy is regarded as a natural talent and part of everyday life by most; while many people envy the powers possessed by Ferrings, they don’t consider these powers to be particularly strange or mysterious. People in the modern day understand the basics of Feruchemy far better than those of the Final Empire, including the principles of storing and tapping, and the basics of the physical and cognitive Feruchemical metals. However, scholarship around the more exotic or ancient types of Feruchemy remains confined to the Terris community — primarily amongst the continuing tradition of the Keepers. \n\n The abilities of Feruchemists make them prized employees in a wide field of professions. Archivist and Sparker Ferrings are popular accountants, secretaries, and clerks, thanks to their infallible memories and great mental agility. Sleepless Sentry Ferrings can often find employment as watchmen or guards, while Brutes have an easy time finding work in construction or as heavies for crime bosses. Connector Ferrings find law and politics natural fits to their skills, and Spinners often try their luck at the gambling table. Subsumers, Gaspers, Firesouls, and Pinnacles are often found on the frontier, where their gifts let them face the unknown with confidence. \n\n However, the limitations of Feruchemy — that one must first store an ability in order to tap it for a short time — restrict how much a Ferring can rely upon his or her powers in daily life. Jobs which utilize their gifts cannot rely upon them to perpetually use them, unlike Mistings (who simply need a steady supply of metal to keep at it). For example, a Sparker salesman is likely to reserve his stored mental speed for only the most challenging clients because every few minutes of quick-thinking brilliance requires several days of dull and plodding thought. Consequently, many employers build in “storing breaks” during the work day to allow a Ferring to build up necessary attributes and only call upon them to tap stored abilities when it is necessary. \n\n Outside of work, Ferrings tend to be more private about their abilities because the personal nature of those powers can cause others to be skeptical of the Feruchemist’s natural abilities and motives. For example, one may question how smart a Sparker or Archivist truly is without her metalminds, whether a Connector with a great number of friends would have them if not for his powers, or if a successful gambler is abusing a chromiummind to win. Like all other people, Ferrings would prefer to be judged not on the existence of their powers but the content of their character, and so when and to whom they reveal their abilities is a personal choice. \n\n Still, some Ferrings have learned to play up their powers to their social advantage. For instance, a Trueself politician or activist might play up his powers of identity to prove his bona fides as a person of strident and unbending morals, while a Pinnacle negotiator may sell his stored determination as a key to winning his clients whatever they want. The ways and hows Ferrings can use their abilities to gain advantages are as numerous and diverse as the people themselves.",

            "terris":"As the birthright of the Terris people, Feruchemy remains a very important part of Terris ethnic identity. Almost 1 in 25 people within the Terris enclaves are Ferrings — about twice the rate of those in greater society. As such, Ferrings have become an instrumental part of day-to-day life within the enclaves, often to the point of being a replacement for the higher technologies practiced in the cities. Possession of Feruchemical gifts within the Terrisfolk is both a point of pride and a call to service, and some Ferrings in those groups consider themselves to be inherently “more Terris” than people who don’t share their gifts. Though Keepers and other leaders of the Terris community do their best to discredit and speak out against such attitudes, Ferrings can often turn their status to their advantage when need be. \n\n Scadrial’s greatest expertise about Feruchemy today resides with the ancient order of the Terris Keepers. With the fall of the Lord Ruler and remaking of the world, the Keepers have turned most of their efforts from preserving historical and social events to acting as the stewards of Feruchemical knowledge. Like their predecessors, these Archivist (Copper) Ferrings use their copperminds to collect and store everything they can discover about Feruchemy for future generations. Their efforts have not gone unrewarded: those Keepers who study Feruchemy have a much more detailed understanding of all sixteen Feruchemical metals and are the best source of information on the uses of the spiritual and hybrid metals. \n\n The Keepers also act as diplomats, working with Feruchemists to ensure the gift is used for the good of the entire Terris community and the world. Some, for example, call upon known Connector or Spinner Ferrings to use their extraordinary powers of relationships or luck to improve the survival of an enclave in peril, while others work to arrange marriages between Ferrings to see that the gift is passed on to the next generation. When Ferrings act out within a Terris community, a Keeper might be assigned to work with local law enforcement or government to bring the rogue in or make sure his or her actions do not reflect poorly upon Terris society as a whole. Naturally, all these duties are kept private; discretion remains a prized trait within the sect.",
            "full":"The weakening of Allomantic ability over time has been well-documented since the World of Ash, when Mistborn went from being the primary type of Allomancer to quite rare at the time of the Lord Ruler. However, the virtual disappearance of “full” Feruchemists has baffled scholars and philosophers alike. Most believe it is simply that the Feruchemical gift will follow the same pattern of Allomancy, growing weaker and more rare over time; some spiritually-minded sorts postulate that Feruchemical ability is breaking down because Allomancy is the gift of the Survivor, able to weather the mixing of blood; and a growing contingent of scientists speculate that it is the introduction of Allomancy into the bloodlines of the Terris that has disrupted the gift of complete Feruchemy. Should this latter theory be correct, it stands to reason that a person of pure and unadulterated Terris heritage might be capable of developing full Feruchemical ability. If such a person does exist, the secretive folk of the Terris enclaves have yet to say…",
            "personality":"Feruchemy is about balance in all things. Since Ferrings must first store traits they wish to use, Feruchemy is inherently more limited than Allomancy. However, it also has one great advantage over Allomancy — the only limit that Ferrings have on the number of charges they can use is the number of charges they have stored in their metalminds. Even the most powerful Thug can barely lift a pony, while a Pewter Ferring with a sufficient number of charges could lift a locomotive. The degree of power possible with Feruchemy can be awe-inspiring, but also necessarily brief. \n\n This balance of storing and tapping means that Ferrings consider themselves to be more thoughtful and careful than Allomancers — they cannot use their powers willy-nilly! Although using any of the physical metals is direct and obvious, even a Pewter or Steel Ferring must still consider how many of their limited number of charges they are willing to use. Maintaining a large store of charges requires forethought, dedication, and sacrifice. \n\n Some Feruchemists, especially those who were raised in the Terris community, believe that Allomancy makes its practitioners lazy and careless, while Feruchemy encourages wisdom, careful deliberation, and an appreciation of the cost of power. Some Ferrings who can use one of the cognitive metals, especially Copper and Zinc, also believe that they can use their metal because they possess superior intelligence — despite the lack of any obvious connection between Feruchemical ability and intelligence."

            "name": "Hemalurgy",
            "basics": "Hemalurgy is the least known, least understood discipline in the Final Empire, practiced almost exclusively at the highest levels of the Steel Ministry. It involves using a metal spike to kill someone, thus stealing one of their characteristics or abilities (and coincidentally, absorbing a piece of the person’s soul in the process). The victim’s death seals the characteristic or ability in the spike, which can then be driven into another person’s body to pass the stolen trait to them. \n\n The size of a Hemalurgic spike can vary widely, and it’s unrelated to the power it contains. The largest (like those found in Steel Inquisitors) can be many inches in length and up to an inch in diameter, while the smallest are no bigger than a sewing needle or a pierced earring. Even when one of these spikes pierces a vital organ like the eyes or heart, it poses no danger unless it’s removed. \n\n A spike must be large enough to kill someone (obviously), but it need not be all of an object used to kill. The tip of a sword that pierces someone in just the right location could become a Hemalurgic spike, for example. \n\n The characteristic or ability stolen by a spike depends on its metal composition. A Steel spike, for instance, steals a Physical Allomantic Power, while a Tin spike steals one of the victim’s senses. As might be evident, this makes Hemalurgic spikes the only way an Allomancer can gain Feruchemy. \n\n Creating a spike is difficult, as the metal must be sufficiently pure and prepared to exacting standards. Using a spike is just as tricky, as incorrect placement and method can completely undermine the process. Sadly, knowledge of these arts has been suppressed for so long as to be largely unknown outside the Steel Ministry. \n\n Also, the incredible power of Hemalurgy is unnatural and takes a great toll. Abilities granted by spikes are essentially shards of another person’s spirit — one that can scramble, weaken, and even pervert the recipient’s will. Worse, spikes that steal characteristics common to all people — like strength, intelligence, or senses — can cause more dramatic corruption, often twisting the body as well as the spirit.",
            "creations": "Arrays of spikes used in combination can even create entirely new beings — most notably the koloss, the kandra, and the Steel Inquisitors. These Hemalurgic creations were once something else, but have since become new species divorced from their forebears by corrupting magic that defines and reshapes them. \n\n Fair Warning: This section contains spoilers for the original Mistborn trilogy. Read at your own risk.",
            "koloss": "Koloss are humans pierced by four iron spikes, often as punishment for rebellion, treason, or sedition. These spikes transform the unfortunate recipients in hideous and inhuman ways — their bodies become incredibly strong, their skin turns blue, their memories fade, and their minds descend into a cycle of boredom, hunger, and rage. Once the transformation is complete, koloss are pressed into service as shock troops, employed in merciless assaults against the Lord Ruler’s enemies. \n\n Koloss continue to grow in height and mass throughout “life,” and those not killed in battle eventually die as their hearts literally burst. Koloss society is a mockery of human culture, built around the rule of might makes right, and fueled by an economy of violence. Only a powerful Allomancer can direct a koloss horde effectively, and so Steel Inquisitors are often at the center of any coordinated koloss action. ",
            "kandra": "Kandra are mistwraiths enhanced by a pair of metal spikes collectively called a “Blessing.” This raises the mistwraith from its mindless existence and also grants new abilities: improved senses from the Blessing of Awareness, enhanced strength and speed from the Blessing of Potency, augmented intelligence and memory from the Blessing of Presence, or enhanced emotional stability from the Blessing of Stability. \n\n Unlike koloss, the kandra breed true and have a complex society, hidden far from human eyes. Most interaction with humans is arranged through a Contract, and paid for in precious atium. Kandra are also vulnerable to control via emotional Allomancy, and go to great lengths to hide this fact from humans. \n\n Kandra hold the Lord Ruler in very high regard, referring to him as “The Father,” though very few speak of their relationship to him.", 
            "inquisitor": "Most powerful of all Hemalurgic creations are the Steel Inquisitors — humans whose bodies have been enhanced by eleven or more Hemalurgic spikes, most notably the twin Steel spikes driven through their eye sockets. Inquisitors possess an amazing collection of abilities — Allomancy, Feruchemy, and other enhancement — making them the most powerful beings in Scadrial, after the Lord Ruler himself.",
            "inqDiagram": "./src/assets/inqDiagram.png",
            "history": "The history and origins of Hemalurgy are completely unknown. There are no records of it before the Lord Ruler’s Ascension, and it’s possible he created the art when he came to power. It may alternately have been discovered prior to the Lord Ruler’s rise, perhaps by accident when a spike of the correct metal impaled someone in just the right spot. Obviously someone got past the horror and disgust of the process, valuing the power it conveyed enough to look past the cost in human life and suffering. \n\n Following the Lord Ruler’s Ascension Hemalurgy was treated as a state secret, revealed only to trusted members of the Steel Ministry. The Lord Ruler used Hemalurgy quite frequently, to produce the Steel Inquisitors, his koloss armies, and the mysterious kandra, but the details of it were kept from everyone else — even the heads of the highest ranking noble families. \n\n The Lord Ruler’s fall would doubtlessly remove some of these boundaries, but the horrifying nature of the art, the precision required for its use, and its incredible toll on one’s humanity, are likely to stymie most forays into its potential.",
            "ascension": "It should come as little surprise that the bloody art of Hemalurgy has waned in the modern day; with the fall of Ruin and the Steel Ministry — the primary practitioners of Hemalurgy in the Final Empire — there are few who understand its complex and corrupting practice. Harmony said nothing of the art in the Words of Founding, and if anyone knows how the art works…they’re not talking. Hemalurgic spikes can still be found in the bodies of full koloss and the Faceless Immortals, but all are relics from the World of Ash and treasured by those whose lives depend upon their preservation. \n\n This is not to say that Hemalurgy is definitely gone, however — merely that knowledge of its intricacies and side effects are lost. And as with any mystery, there are those whose curiosity, greed, or thirst for adventure may drive them to search for the answer. Harmony help those who find them.",
            "mechanical": "There are two types of Hemalurgic spikes — the traditional spikes used to steal and transfer from one person to another, and the kandra’s Blessings. In both cases the specific effects of using the spike are based on its metal composition. \n\n Some spikes have a Power rating of 2 to 10, and others simply have a simple effect or grant a single ability with no rating. When Hemalurgy has a rating, it represents the strength of the characteristic or ability transferred. \n\n Once a traditional spike is correctly driven into a character, he or she can use the characteristics and/or abilities it grants, and all rules that applied before they were stolen also apply to the new owner. Thus, a character who gains an Allomantic Power from a spike may ingest the corresponding metal to gain charges, and burn or flare those charges at will, while a character who gains a Feruchemical Power may store charges in a metalmind and tap them later, both using all the rules in the previous two chapters. \n\n Because abilities stolen with Hemalurgy are actually someone else’s, a character who gains Feruchemy may use metalminds that belonged to the person killed by the spike (as the character is, quite literally, using that person’s power). \n\n The effects of Blessings are described in the kandra section.",
            "options": [
                {
                    "option": "When building a Hero, a player can begin play with Blessings if a kandra"

                }
            ],
            "startRate": "The rating of each spike, or set of spikes, is noted where it’s gained, and this rating may never improve. The characteristics and/or abilities in each spike are stolen from someone else, and forever set at their development at the time of death. \n\n A character with one or more spikes may still learn Stunts for any transferred Powers that have them, since those are developed through experience and training. Should a spike ever be removed, however, the character loses access to all associated Stunts until and unless he ever regains the same spike. \n\n You can’t just drive a spike in anywhere. Placement is a tricky process, even with an inkling of where it should go in the body. It’s similar to surgery — you might know that someone’s stomach hurts, and you might even know that it’s appendicitis, but actually removing an appendix requires years of training and practice. I suggest that if a Crew finds a spike or three and wants to use them, they should undertake a story-driven quest for a detailed explanation of how to place those particular spikes, or someone who can place them, before anyone should be allowed to spend Advancements to gain their benefits.",
            "combining": "Spikes can enhance a character’s pre-existing Powers, providing a quick but dangerous shortcut to extraordinary power. This is most effective with Allomancy, as demonstrated by Zane’s incredible skill with Steel and the uncanny Bronze Allomancy of Inquisitors in the novels. \n\n When an Allomancer gains a spike granting ability with a metal he can already use, his rating with that metal increases by the spike’s rating. If this increases the rating above 10, any extra is converted to Nudges when the character rolls with the Power. \n\n By contrast, spikes are much less useful to Feruchemists. When a Feruchemist gains a spike granting Feruchemy, he or she gains no benefit other than possible access to metalminds belonging to whomever the Feruchemy was stolen from. This is, in fact, the only way one Feruchemist can use the metalminds of another. ",
            "drawback": "The horrific nature of the Hemalurgic arts, and the physical, mental, and spiritual conflicts they incite, gradually warp the body, mind, and soul of anyone who benefits from them. For each spike, a character’s Wits, Charm, Spirit, or combination of the three are reduced by 1, depending on the spike’s metal, as described in each metal’s chapter later in this Treatise. Blessings are the only exception to this rule — they don’t suffer this penalty because the spikes actually create them, and are responsible for their sentience. \n\n As when any score is reduced, all derived values are also reduced. This means that a spike that reduces a character’s Charm also reduces his or her Reputation by the same amount, just as a spike that reduces Wits or Spirit also reduces Willpower. Some spikes may change a character even further, as described in each metal’s chapter later in the Treatise. \n\n Hemalurgic spikes are also a vehicle by which Ruin can communicate with and corrupt the bearer — first through hallucinations or ethereal voices but more and more directly as additional spikes are gained. Should a character’s Charm, Wits, or Spirit ever drop to 0 as a result of gaining a spike, he or she winds up an automaton of the dark god, falling under the Narrator’s control. Sadly, this means the player will have to build a new character, as his or her previous one isn’t fit for the work of Heroes anymore. \n\n Finally, Hemalurgic creations like koloss, kandra, and Steel Inquisitors can be controlled with suitably powerful emotional Allomancy, as described on page 226.",
            "using": "The process for using Hemalurgic spikes is a complete mystery outside the Steel Ministry at the time of the original Mistborn trilogy, and poorly understood even by the Lord Ruler himself. As a result, most spikes gained through Advancements or as a byproduct of your story should come with a strong story not only for how the spike is acquired but also how the knowledge for its use is obtained. \n\n Using a spike to steal a characteristic or ability involves pounding a sharp metal object of the correct metal composition and purity through a victim’s body, piercing a particular vital organ or area. If the strike is precise enough, the victim is instantly slain and a piece of his spirit is transferred to the spike. Only one characteristic or ability may be stolen from each victim, even if the victim possesses more than one that qualifies. \n\n A spike only gains a rating when the stolen characteristic or ability has one, and then the rating is 1 lower than the original characteristic or ability (minimum 2). \n\n Once imbued with power, a spike must be driven into a new body relatively soon or it starts to lose its potency. For each week a spike goes without being inserted into a new body, its rating drops by 1 (to a minimum of 2). A spike with no rating never degrades.",
            "decay": "It’s mentioned in the books that a Hemalurgic spike can become “stale” by remaining too long outside a body. The powers it grants can decay — never to the point that the spike is entirely useless, but without very special preparations a spike left outside of a body will slowly lose some of its charge and grant less and less power.",
            "removal": "Hemalurgic spikes must penetrate vital organs such as the eyes, heart, or another vital area to transfer their power, and while this doesn’t present an immediate danger when a spike is first driven in, removing one can be severely traumatic and very often fatal. \n\n There are two ways to remove a spike: manually or with powerful Allomantic Pulling or Pushing. Manual removal requires the character to be immobilized or incapacitated, and for another character to succeed with a Physique 5 roll. An Allomancer can also Steelpush or Ironpull a spike from a character’s body, but only with an Outcome of 5 or higher in a Contest of his metal vs. the character’s Physique. \n\n Each time a character loses a spike, he or she immediately loses 5 Health, and if this reduces the character’s Health to 0 or less he or she instantly dies from the trauma. A character who survives may recover naturally or through Breathers or magic — not only regaining this lost Health over time, but also the point of Charm, Wits, or Spirit forfeit when the spike was driven in. However, the characteristics and/or abilities the spike granted, as well as any Advancements spent to gain the spike, are lost for good (or at least until the same spike is driven back in). \n\n A removed spike may be transferred to another character at no Advancement cost, though that character still loses a point of Charm, Wits, Spirit, or a combination of those, as usual. \n\n Most Hemalurgic creations, like koloss and Steel Inquisitors, are slain if their spikes are removed — even when they have enough Health to survive process. Kandra who lose their last Blessing devolve back into mindless mistwraiths, returning to sentience and memory only if they receive their spikes again, or are fortunate enough to gain a new set."

        {
            "id":4,
            "name":"Twinborn",
            "basics":"Twinborn are rare and fortunate individuals who wield the rarest magical power of all: the ability to use both Allomancy and Feruchemy. The combination of these two Metallic Arts was unheard of prior to the Origin, but Harmony’s new world has allowed for the mingling of Allomantic and Feruchemical bloodlines, and in so doing created a whole new type of metalborn. While some Twinborn are the scions of noble families who married Terris shortly after the Origin, the descendants of Allomancers and Terris Keepers can come from all backgrounds and social strata. People whose parents lacked any Allomantic or Feruchemical abilities are almost as likely to become Twinborn as someone who is the child of an Allomancer and a Feruchemist. \n\n Each Twinborn is both a Misting and a Ferring, but only capable of using two metals. While this may seem weaker than the Mistborn and Keepers of the World of Ash, they are the only people who can use more than one type of metal in modern times. Additionally, the Twinborn’s ability to combine a Feruchemical and Allomantic power allows them to circumvent the limitations facing a normal Ferring or Allomancer. For instance, a Crasher Twinborn with the ability to use Allomantic Steel (Push on metal objects) and Feruchemical Iron (store and tap weight) can use her two abilities in unison to fly through the air more effectively than a Coinshot or push at objects far heavier than herself. Meanwhile, a Twinborn with the ability to use Feruchemical Gold and Allomantic Bendalloy can use his time-bubbles to give himself more time to store health, allowing him to heal more quickly and more often. \n\n In some rarer cases, a Twinborn is able to use the same Feruchemical and Allomantic metal, which allows him or her to perform Compounding. These Compounders can Allomantically burn their own metalminds, which exponentially amplifies the power of their stored charges and creates unusual but vastly powerful results. Compounded abilities are, in effect, an entirely new power which many Compounders commit their lives to mastering.",
            "society":"The majority of people who can’t use magic aren’t usually able to distinguish Twinborn from either Mistings or Ferrings, typically because Twinborn are so much rarer than the other types of metalborn. What most folk do know is that Twinborn are rare and sometimes dangerous individuals with impressive powers — either heroes torn from the pages of the latest pulp, or villains of sensationalist newspapers or campfire stories. Amongst other metalborn, Twinborn are regarded with a certain amount of suspicion (by those who do not trust their commitment or understanding of their powers) or envy (by those who covet a Twinborn’s potency). No matter what the individual attitudes are, nearly all folks can’t help but be impressed by what Twinborn can do when they truly exercise their power. \n\n Unlike Mistings and Ferrings, not many Twinborn seek specific employment based solely on the types of powers they possess — rather, those that hire them do so based on the Twinborn’s unique combinations of abilities. Twinborn with powers from both the Allomantic and Feruchemical physical metals may find themselves highly sought-after as lawkeepers, enforcers, or mercenaries; while those with more exotic combinations may find themselves the subject of academic or esoteric business ventures. Compounder Twinborn are the most pursued types of all, thanks to both their raw power and mythical reputation that ranks amongst the greatest heroes and legends of the Final Empire. Both riches and reputation can be easily won by those Twinborn willing to exploit their abilities to the fullest.",
            "types":"There are 256 different possible combinations of Twinborn in The Alloy of Law era, based on the metals that have been discovered and are available. The combinations of Allomantic and Feruchemical powers range from spectacularly powerful (as is the case with Crashers, who use Allomantic Steel and Feruchemical Iron to become engines of Metallic destruction) to middling, to outright indistinguishable from other Ferrings or Mistings (as is the case with any Twinborn using Allomantic Aluminum or Duralumin or Feruchemical Nicrosil). \n\n The table on page 180 lists nicknames and perceptions of notable types of Twinborn. These names change frequently with popular culture but should provide good grist for your own names and ideas!",
            "compounding":"Compounding is the most potent form of magic known in The Alloy of Law era. By combining Allomancy and Feruchemy in the same metal, a Compounder can burn charged metalminds, greatly enhancing their stored abilities and granting new abilities unavailable through other, more conventional powers. More importantly, Compounded metalminds release exponentially more power, which allows the Twinborn to overcome the central limitation of Feruchemy: that you can only tap as much of an ability as you have first stored. \n\n Compounders describe burning a metalmind as an incredible rush of power, like the feeling of burning any Allomantic metal, except far stronger. A few Compounders describe the feeling in terms most often used for strong intoxicants, euphoria, or a massive jolt of adrenaline.",

When you Compound, you Allomantically burn a charged metalmind (in game terms, the Feruchemical charges you’ve stored in that metalmind) to gain a massive jolt of Feruchemical power. This power can be spent to provide huge Feruchemical benefits or to activate abilities unachievable through Allomancy or Feruchemy alone (represented by Compounding Stunts, found on page 183). \n\n You may only Compound a metalmind that is in your body — thus, you must either ingest a metalmind, or pierce your body with it (such as an earring or non-Hemalurgic spike) in order to burn it and gain the benefits of Compounding. A metalmind in your body, whether swallowed or in a piercing, is still considered in physical contact, so you can still use Feruchemy to store and tap charges in it normally. Typically only small metalminds (capable of holding 25 charges) can be used for Compounding since they’re small enough to swallow or pierce an ear or nose without excessive damage.",

These charges can be spent like normal Feruchemical charges, used to activate Compounding Stunts, stored in another metalminds, or a combination of the three. Note that even though you can generate a huge amount of Feruchemical charges in this way, the maximum number of Feruchemical charges you can spend per action or roll is still limited to your Feruchemy rating × 10, as normal.",

However, there are some limitations you’ll need to deal with — Compounding isn’t simple! \n\n To get the most out of your Compounding, you’ll want your Feruchemy rating and Allomancy Rating to keep pace with each other so that you can Compound enough charges and be able to spend those charges. Unless you plan to rely on your Allomancy for its normal Allomantic effects quite a bit, it’s usually best to increase your Feruchemy first, since you can still tap a bunch of charges normally without using Compounding if you need to. Also watch for other limits on your metal (like the previous example of Physique limiting how many charges of caloric energy Jann can store per hour). \n\n You’ll need to store in and ingest metalminds frequently, so look at taking more metalminds as Props so you have a steady supply. Juggling your inventory so you have metalminds ready to Compound when you need them is all part of being a Compounder. \n\n Though Compounding uses Allomancy to enhance Feruchemy, and the Feruchemical abilities are what Twinborn are known for, don’t forget you’re still a fully capable Allomancer! Take Misting vials or pouches as Props so you have a supply that isn’t reliant on just metalminds. \n\n Though you start off a bit behind on Stunts, you can do some amazing things once you’re able to buy a Compounding Stunt. It’s a great idea to look at the Compounding Stunt options for your metal early on and buy one you like once you have the Advancements to spend."

These unique effects are represented by Compounding Stunts, and are identified by the word “Compounding” in parentheses following their names. Any Compounder Twinborn Hero may gain Compounding Stunts corresponding to his metals during play using Advancements. \n\n Nearly all Compounding Stunts can only be used if the Compounder spends large amounts of Feruchemical charges. Unless noted otherwise, all Feruchemical charges spent to activate Compounding Stunts must be gained through Compounding; these are referred to in these Stunts as “Compounded charges.” \n\n For instance, if you Compound 4 charges from a pewtermind, you can use the resulting 40 charges to activate the Earthshaker Compounding Stunt, as normal Pewter Feruchemical charges, or a combination of the two. However, if you tap 40 charges from your pewtermind using Feruchemy, you can only use those charges as normal — you can’t use your Earthshaker Stunt."

You’ll make friends and enemies, enjoy epic triumphs and suffer vicious setbacks, and your choices and actions will only change the world but set the stage for many more adventures to come. In the end you’ll find that you’ve not only written your own legend but lived it, and the experience will stay with you long after the game is done.",
            "neverPlayed": "A tabletop roleplaying game (or RPG for short) is a bit different from other games. Instead of a screen and controller, or a board and pieces, you play with your imagination. You create and control a character, just like you would in a video game RPG, but here you can literally become anyone you can envision living in the Final Empire, and your options in play are only limited by what’s plausible in your character’s situation (and that will change from moment to moment). \n\n There are no preset locations to explore and your goals are whatever you want them to be. The world continues around you, even if you do nothing, and other characters act in rational ways because both the world and those other characters are controlled by actual people — your friends, who are also players in the game. \n\n Video games like to toss around the term “sandbox” to identify RPGs that let you wander in an open world, exploring areas, interacting with other characters, and tackling quests as you see fit. This is also true of the Mistborn Adventure Game, but without the limitations of what’s programmed to happen. You can go anywhere and try anything. You even set your own goals, though as we say, the world and other characters are controlled by actual people, and they may have other ideas. \n\n Playing an RPG is a lot like improvisational theatre: you have an idea who your character is, what he or she can do, and the situation you’re facing, but it’s how you act that matters. As in theater there’s no “winning” or “losing” — everyone wins just for playing and having a good time with friends. Of course your character has goals, and there’s joy in realizing those, but the real excitement is had in stretching your creative muscles — in walking in someone else’s shoes, and creating something new and memorable along the way. \n\n You might wonder whether that’s the only challenge in the game — whether the only hurdle is mastering the art of communal storytelling. It’s not. Your Hero’s actions are often bold (some might say “daring,” others “stupid”). There’s always risk in truly courageous efforts, and the Mistborn Adventure Game uses dice to determine the outcome of your riskiest actions. Part of the challenge (and the fun!) lies in learning what comes next, and thinking on your feet quickly and bravely enough to survive, and thrive, against even the most dangerous odds. \n\n You have an opportunity here to do something important in Scadrial, to take up a mantle few have considered for a thousand years, and truly own the title of “Hero” in a world of Villains. Strike out on your own in a game without limits, and finally answer that age-old question: “How would I have done it differently?” There’s only one way to find out. Keep reading, and dream...",
            "experienced": "For those of you who’ve played RPGs before, the Mistborn Adventure Game is a relatively rules-light, strongly narrative storytelling game. There are no levels, no “grinding” for XP, and no killing things and taking their stuff. The mechanics are straightforward enough that you can easily create the character you want and get going with minimum fuss, transparent enough that they fade into the background whenever they aren’t needed, and just robust enough to model a wide variety of fairly complex situations. \n\n Features include social and mental conflicts, story-driven bonuses, and a trouble-free dice system ensuring the rules support, rather than impede, your fun. Fans of indie games like FATE, Savage Worlds, and Storyteller should feel right at home with the Mistborn Adventure Game, and may recognize many core assumptions throughout. \n\n Of course, the Mistborn novels are known for their incredibly potent and diverse magic systems, and the Adventure Game places those front and center without sacrificing balance. Great effort has been taken to ensure characters from any background can all contribute strongly, whether they have magic or not, and even if they’re born slaves, or worse. This is accomplished through a quick choice of priorities during character creation, whereby characters without magic or with less magic than others, are given other setting-appropriate perks and abilities (personal strengths and standing in society).",
            "needPlay": "Friends: At least one and ideally three to five. One of you becomes the Narrator, who like the author of a novel sets the stage and directs the many Villains and Extras who populate the world. Unlike a novel author however, the Narrator doesn’t control the protagonists of this saga — that’s the job of the other players, who are called Heroes. (These other players are always called “Heroes,” even when their goals and actions venture into wicked territory, for even the truest villains think themselves the heroes of their own stories.) Together, your Heroes form a Crew, which works together to accomplish goals, face challenges set forth by the Narrator, and explore the dangers and mysteries of the Final Empire. \n\n Dice: The Mistborn Adventure Game uses six-sided dice (the cube-shaped ones you find in most family board games), and you should have at least five to ten of them. The Narrator and most players will probably want their own sets but it isn’t required. These dice are used to determine many things, including whether Heroes, Villains, and Extras succeed or fail at difficult tasks, and sometimes how well they do when they succeed, or what complications arise when they fail. \n\n Paper: The Narrator will want to keep notes and track the conditions and abilities of his Villains and Extras, and the Heroes will want to do the same. We provide sheets for these purposes starting on page 556 and you can photocopy these if you like. \n\n Imagination: A roleplaying game is a storytelling exercise and every player — the Narrator and every Hero — contributes to the outcome and fun of the story. This is part of what makes a roleplaying game different from other games: your input makes it a unique experience every time you play, and your collaboration contributes to a world and story that’s very much your own. The more imagination each of you brings to the game, the more creativity each of you contributes, the greater your story becomes and the more memorable it is for everyone.",
            "narrator":"Start by reading “What Makes a Character”, which explains the building blocks common to Heroes, Villains, and Extras. You can skip the rest of Building Heroes until you’re familiar with how the game plays. The basic rules of play are essential, as is “Playing the Narrator” in Book 3, which talks about running the game. You can also read through “Creating Your Own Characters”, or you can keep it simple and use the samples provided on starting on the left. \n\n As everyone will be learning for the first few sessions, we recommend you keep your first adventure small — no more than three sessions — and let everyone adjust their characters right after it ends. You’ll want to read through all of Books 1 and 2 before then, so you can tweak your plans and characters as well.",
            "everyoneElse": "After your first read-through of Building Heroes, you should be able to create a character in under 10 minutes (a little more if you spend lots of time considering the options and adding flavor to your Hero). If this is your first time playing an RPG and you want to see how it all works before creating your own Hero, or you don’t really know what kind of character you want right now, several samples are included. \n\n Game Basics start on page 131, and it’s helpful to know as much about them as possible, though players other than the Narrator only really need to understand how to form pools, roll dice, and use Nudges. The rest you can learn as you play."

You’re keeping track though and each indignity will cost them, big. You’re a mastermind and your crew — the well-regarded Nine Eyes — operates smoothly thanks to you always planning five steps ahead. \n\n Your parents were loyal, obedient sorts who raised you well. They taught you to anticipate the needs of your betters, and those lessons gave you an edge over most skaa in the eyes of the nobility. Nevertheless, when a terrible sickness swept through the city in your youth, your parents and brother were left to die. Everything changed, and you became your own man, family first and curse the Lord Ruler. \n\n Now you have a thriving public business, a wife, two strong boys, and everything is going great. Your family doesn’t know about your criminal activities but you sometimes catch your beloved looking at you with just a hint of suspicion, and you worry about what she’ll do if she finds out the truth. \n\n Among your crewmates, Thorrow is a worry. You’ve got a gut feeling that it’s only a matter of time before he loses it, and you’ve taken precautions to distance yourself and the crew if that should happen. Still, you can’t help caring and you hope that it doesn’t come to that. \n\n Sev’s drinking is getting out of hand, but confronting him means getting past his sister, which is difficult to consider once she starts fluttering those perfect lashes. Wait, you’re married, aren’t you? \n\n Damosi and Gavon remind you so much of your sons. Damosi always follows his own agenda like your oldest, and Gavon, like your youngest, he’s got no agenda at all. The combination could be trouble, but really, how could you turn them away? \n\n JeHoy... Normally you’d be a lot less keen to keep one of “those things” around, but this one’s proved more level-headed and conscious of the crew’s needs than many so-called “professionals” you’ve had at your side.

Fortunately it’s a job you can do almost anywhere, as you learn as much from the assumptions of those outside the city as from those who live there. \n\n Working with a crew lets you move between social classes and quarters, and with every job you store more knowledge in your metalminds. So long as that continues, you’re happy to keep with the Nine Eyes and see where the future leads. \n\n A strange thing happened in your youth — you slipped through the cracks. The Obligators didn’t realize you were a Feruchemist, but neither did the Terris people. Only years later, when you traveled to Luthadel as a young steward, did an older Keeper named Gahela discover and nurture your abilities. She risked everything to get you a meeting with the Synod, and you still regret that she didn’t survive the journey. It’s Gahela’s path you now walk, for she was Luthadel’s chronicler before you. The Synod charged you with her duties and so you honor them, and her sacrifice, with every detail gleaned. \n\n Lately, your research has led you in an unexpected direction. You’ve found yourself listening in on private conversations between members of the crew and people with especially rare knowledge of the capital. You don’t plan to use anything you learn against the crew of course, but you know this could be seen as a betrayal, and so you stay quiet and hope you never have to choose between your mission and your friends. \n\n Beck is a good leader, and a sensible man. He truly listens and respects your knowledge. Not everyone does. Still, he’s so... “practical.” Does he serve any cause bigger than the welfare of his own family? \n\n You and the younger Terrisman, Gavon, were born to the same breeder.

You constantly press your luck, often overstepping the bounds of your assumed position, and you’ve even tipped off a few of your employers (though so far you and the crew have made sure your secret went no further). \n\n The real danger, of course, is other stewards. It’s easier for them to spot you as a fake. Some don’t say anything but others think they can use what they learn to their advantage. It’s more trouble for you and the crew, but what can you do? It’s part of the life. \n\n You actually were a steward for a little while. The training seemed exciting at the time, so close to the nobility, but you now know how demeaning it really is. The Lord Ruler takes so much from the Terris people; does he need your dignity as well? \n\n Your first assignment as a steward sent you to a small country outpost belonging to House Hasting. It was a dreadful experience. Not only was the lord unbearably cruel to his skaa but he forced you to join in their humiliation. You slipped away as soon as you could. \n\n Your next assignment took you to Luthadel, where you were approached and recruited by the Nine Eyes.

When he couldn’t afford to pay his debts to a Soother named Sev (who was posing as a noble at the time), he offered your services for two years instead. Those two years cannot pass quickly enough. \n\n You bristle working for these thieves but do as the Contract dictates. Sev’s orders are often maddeningly vague or risky, and they frequently conflict with your own sensible, conservative opinions. You always have to keep those all-important words of kandra wisdom in mind: “You must compel me under the Contract to my true employer, his rights temporarily transferred to you by proxy.” \n\n At least the crew finds you useful. You’re often tasked as an infiltrator and your Blessing of Awareness makes up for the fact that they have no Tineye.

You much prefer it there, with your elegant hardwood True Body and its intricate carvings. Human flesh still feels a bit strange, and you sometimes itch or adjust yourself involuntarily — a quirk that’s nearly gotten you into trouble more than once. \n\n Your inexperience might even have caused you to kill. Before you started with the Nine Eyes, Damien had you infiltrate a group of skaa merchants. They saw through your disguise and you left one of them bleeding on the ground as you escaped.

You live in fear that someone in the Homeland waits for your return... for you to face the consequences of your traitorous actions. \n\n Sev often asks you to work with Gavon, the one who poses as a steward, so he can refine your infiltration and blending skills.

Some of them took a bit more interest when you were a teen and demonstrated that you were Twinborn, but by that time, you had learned that most of them cared only for what you could do and had no love for you. \n\n When you came of age, your grandfather offered you a minor position in the family banking business, but you wanted answers. You sold your possessions, bought a gun and a horse, and set out for the Roughs to locate your mother. You eventually found her sick and impoverished, robbed and left for dead a year before by a gang of 4 bandits. You helped her as best you could, nursing her through the last few months of her life. Then you set out after the bandits; you learned to use your bronzeminds to put off sleep and keep yourself alert for a fight, and you figured out how your Allomancy could keep situations peaceful and persuade people to talk to you. \n\n At the end of six months, you’d killed one bandit and captured the other three. Along the way you learned to like the money, but you liked the feeling of making the Roughs a safer place even more. You tell yourself that you don’t care about your family, but you also know that you want to become famous enough as a bounty hunter that you can ride back into Elendel someday with a fine horse and a finer reputation. Maybe then your grandfather and cousins will look upon you as an equal. \n\n In the meantime, you’ve become the unwitting leader of a whole passel of miscreants and wanderers. You have to keep a close watch over Sperry, but Enid knows what she’s doing and is a real professional. You’ve got respect for Anders’ convictions; if you could be a man of faith and stand up for a principle, you would. But that’s not the world you live in. ",

She was gentle and compassionate in ways you’d never considered possible. She told you to reject your spikes and instead go to school, to learn and lead your people on a path toward progress. She gave you an earring and a wad of notes, and then vanished. So you went. \n\n Harmony seemed to have paved your way through university. It was, perhaps, more enlightening than it was educational. Your degree is some words on a piece of paper, but your understanding of the way humans do things was enough to help you reject both lifestyles in parts. You realized even if the koloss way of life won’t last forever, human society has its own shortcomings. You know your people need another path — one of education, land, respect. Even in the Roughs, those things cost money. \n\n It’s difficult to explain to humans what it means to refuse the spikes. Yours is the blood of chiefs, but you’ll never be able to make children with other koloss. You’ll never have a mate, never be a sire. That pain eats at you. You may shepherd other koloss-blooded some day, guide them into the world of humanity, but you worry it won’t be the same. \n\n You have an uneasy respect for what Anders does, though you don’t put much stock in his manner of religion. “Bandy” Jann irritates you, sometimes badly, so you try to use her to practice self-control.

No one is too high or too low for your tastes. \n\n Your pappy was the greatest grifter anywhere out in the Roughs and half the city besides. He built confidence and knocked it down as easy as some folks breathe. But what he couldn’t do is steal confidence. That’s where you blew him out of the water. It’s a ruined shame the way he had to take the fall, but at least he’s just in prison forever, ’stead of hanged. \n\n Of course, that wasn’t what really got you into the Crew. It was Grinnel who melted it down and forged it — you were too good at what you do, and were like as not to end up like your pappy should you stay anywhere too long. He said that what you needed were limits, to do a little good with your Connector skills to keep your neck out of the noose. You were skeptical at first, but so far, it’s worked out. A little push and pull here and there, and the Crew at least tolerates your…activities. Plus Grinnel covers for you and keeps you as honest as he can. It ain’t a bad deal. \n\n Most men got secrets; way you figure it, your worst and deepest secret is the truth — about you, about your life, everything. You’ve been at this for so long you don’t even know when you’re lying anymore. You’d like to have an honest relationship, maybe find a fella who could really see you for who you are with no malarkey involved, but you ain’t holding your breath. \n\n The Crew trusts you because they sort of have to, and there are some days you’re not even sure if you’re running a con on them or not. Aside from Grinnel keeping you true as titanium, you’ve made quite the ally in Janella. When money is running low, sometimes you and she slip off, do a little side job to raise some capital, and hope for the best.

They must also overcome great hardships on the road to glory or infamy, rising above devastating poverty, institutionalized oppression, ethnic cleansing, and sometimes even the shackles of slavery. This struggle to realize one’s calling without falling prey to the demons of the past is the mark of a true hero. \n\n Many characters in your story have a Destiny (a higher purpose, which may or may not have been fated), and a Tragedy (a traumatic event or memory that haunts the character to this day). All Heroes have both, and many Villains do as well. \n\n A Hero’s Destiny or Tragedy may be unknown to the Hero (or even the player) when the game starts, becoming something to discover. A player or Hero may also believe his or her Destiny is one thing when it’s really another. Meanwhile, the Narrator knows all characters’ Destinies and Tragedies, including the Villains’, though he or she may decide a Villain is unaware and roleplay accordingly. \n\n Destiny and Tragedy unfold like subplots, in that they have Beginnings, Middles, and Ends, and their game effects are progressively more potent the deeper you get into their story. The Narrator may sometimes have you script your own Destinies and Tragedies, especially if he or she wants you to embrace and apply them as you describe your character’s actions. Most of the time, though, you’ll identify your character’s Destiny and Tragedy and the Narrator will develop the scripts so that part of your character’s story is gradually revealed over the course of the game. \n\n It’s possible your character may fulfill his or her Destiny, or conquer his or her Tragedy in play — this is often the meat of truly mighty storytelling, after all — and such a momentous event warrants care, attention, and celebration within the Crew. The Narrator might even decide it merits new Advancements (see page 113) or even a Turning Point (see page 428).",
            "brandon2": "One thing to keep in mind is that a great character often has a great limitation, or in game terms, a great Tragedy. Don’t look at it as a weakness you’re annoyed to have. Look at it as one of the most defining aspects of who your character is. All great heroes from fiction — from Spiderman to Frodo to Jean Valjean — have defining moments like this in their past, and you should too. Often, it is what a character cannot do that makes them truly come alive.",

They’re also a currency more valuable than atium; Vin’s discovery of Duralumin grants her a tremendous edge over other Mistborn, and TenSoon’s revelation about the kandra not only signs his death warrant but also helps him change the course of history. \n\n In the Mistborn Adventure Game, Secrets can impact the story (the location of a hidden base, for example, or the identity of a long-sought assassin), or they can impact the rules (access to a hidden cache of atium grants great Allomantic power, as does learning to control koloss or kandra with Allomancy). Some very precious Secrets do both these things. \n\n Revealing a Secret at the right time can also offer significant advantages with certain tasks or against the right opponents. For example, a Hero hunting a masked thief might spread the thief’s true identity across a city, making it far easier to capture him. Alternatively, the Hero might only reveal the Secret to someone the thief loves, knowing it would drive a wedge between them. \n\n You may discover Secrets through play, or as you complete Schemes and achieve other goals. Much more information about Secrets can be found in Book 3 (see pages 427 and 455)."

They have a few thoughts about the types of Heroes they want to play, but Brandon has advised them to nail down why they work together before getting too deep into their individual stories. \n\n Peter describes his concept: a skaa fixer working for nobles who secretly hates them. Knowing that character creation is all about questions, Brandon asks why. Peter thinks on it a moment and decides that his Hero’s family died when a disease swept through their home city, and that his Hero couldn’t save them because the nobility cordoned off infected parts of the city rather than tend to the sick. \n\n Ben wants to play a street thief Misting, and he likes this noble angle. He suggests that maybe his Hero has a dark secret: that he murdered a young noble who was getting a little too frisky with his sister, and buried the body outside their home city. (Anticipating Brandon’s next question, he quickly looks at the world map and adds that his Hero’s home city is Fadrex.) \n\n Emily wants to play a kandra, so among other things she has to consider whether her Hero has a Contract, and if so, who it’s with and what that means for the Crew. Until this discussion, she’d assumed her Hero was Contracted to a noble, but she likes the direction this is going and wonders aloud if maybe Peter’s Hero might hold her Contract instead. Always a little mischievous, Ben interjects that maybe his street thief won her Contract in a game of shelldry and after a good laugh, the group agrees. \n\n “It’s for the best,” Emily says, already settling into character. “I never liked my former master anyway.” \n\n Always with the questions, Brandon asks why. (“Why?” is the most powerful question of all during Hero creation, and indeed at any point in the game when you need more detail.) \n\n Emily decides it’s because her former master was abusive and kept sending her on dangerous jobs that he didn’t want to be linked to. “That’s another noble we don’t like,” Peter adds, and the Crew’s cause and target start to come together. \n\n “You all have problems with nobles,” Brandon observes, and everyone looks to the last player. \n\n Isaac is thinking of playing a Terrisman Keeper, and while he doesn’t have an immediate idea for why his Hero might dislike nobles, he proposes that perhaps a Keeper might join the Crew because of what he might learn from their jobs. Brandon already knows that most of the story will take place in Luthadel, so he submits that maybe the Synod sent Isaac’s Hero to learn more about the city — and what better way than working against its nobility? \n\n All that’s left is determining the Crew’s preferred method. Isaac would like the Crew to remain fairly low-profile so his personal mission isn’t obscured by a lot of fighting, and the others like the idea of their jobs hitting the nobility where it hurts. Peter hits the nail on the head, saying, “We take back what’s ours. We’re thieves.” \n\n The Crew’s cause, target, and method are in place: they seek revenge (cause) on the nobility (target) through theft (method). Everyone jots these details down on their sheets, and the discussion moves on to fleshing out the individual Heroes.",

He suggests 'reserved' and she agrees. Emily suggests 'quiet' for Isaac’s Keeper, but he’s not so sure about this.

They set out from the Terris mountains together but she never made it to Luthadel, and so his Tragedy is that “My mentor died before I could learn everything from her.” \n\n Brandon really likes the underlying idea but doesn’t think it’s quite a Tragedy yet — for that Isaac’s Hero needs to feel a little more responsible for the mentor’s death. Isaac agrees but all the ideas he comes up with immediately are too convoluted or don’t feel right. “Don’t worry,” Brandon says. “We can fill in the details when we have a better grasp of your Hero. Give your mentor a name, though. We’ll need that much before we start.” Isaac’s fine with this, so he writes “Gahela died because of my weakness” on his character sheet. He’s excited to learn more about Gahela’s final days.",

As outsiders, mercenaries, criminals, outlaws, and rebels, members may find themselves always on the run, dead at the hands of an enemy, slowly withering away in prison, or tormented under an interrogator’s knife. No one in their right mind would take such chances unless they believed the rewards outweighed the risk — not even a Hero. \n\n Beyond your character’s motives for joining the crew, imagine what he or she believes they’re meant to do. In a perfect world, with all the right tools at hand, what does your character think or hope to accomplish? This is a personal question, and should be answered separately for each character, above and beyond the goals and dreams of the crew. \n\n Your answer should differ from your Drive Trait (see Question 1, page 82), though it can certainly be related. If your character is a noble who joined the crew hoping to rebuild his name, he might believe his ultimate purpose is to lead his house to victory over a rival. Likewise, a thief may have thrown in with the other heroes to become famous, all the while dreaming of finding a secret so powerful it will shake the Empire to its foundations. \n\n This is your chance to think big. Your answer to this final question should be something your character can’t possibly achieve on his or her own, something grand in scope that’s daring and dangerous enough to be truly worthy of a Hero.

Beyond the questions they typically answer, they should ask what led to each of the improvements they’ve made to their characters, and ideally tie their answers together as a group narrative of what’s come before.

Whenever you improve your Hero, you should consider carefully not only what you’d like to change or add, but also what makes sense in the game world. If your Hero has been spending a lot of time acquiring wealth, you might want to increase his or her Resources. Lots of brutal scraps might indicate it’s time to look at increasing your Hero’s Physique, while a focus using one particular Power might justify a similar focus on boosting its effectiveness. \n\n Of course you can improve your Hero however you like, even if the story doesn’t support it, though the Narrator always has to approve every enhancement before it’s applied.",

Other times a character may stumble into greatness, developing in ways no one expects, as shown with Spook’s dramatic transformation in The Hero of Ages. \n\n Grand schemes are often elaborate, involving many steps that may unfold as full stories on their own, and characters undertaking such wild endeavors could wind up earning Advancements at each step, or after every few, as appropriate to the narrative. Kelsier’s plot to overthrow the Lord Ruler is a classic example of this, with sparking a rebellion to draw off the Luthadel garrison, instigating a war between houses Tekiel and Elariel, planting Marsh within the Steel Ministry, slipping Vin into noble society, and getting away with the Lord Ruler’s treasures each being a distinct goal that might reward Advancements en route to the ultimate prize."

She Snaps as a Pewter Misting, though it does her no good until the condition wears off, many hours later. \n\n Fortunately for Shayna, her only ally in the family recognizes her death for what it really is — not just a debilitating condition but also a sign of latent Allomantic talents, just as exhibited in several of their ancestors (the rest of the family is far too greedy and self-occupied to read, let alone read about people who’ve been dead for hundreds of years).

A Crew of this sort may be working for themselves, a wealthy patron, a university, or a township, seeking anything from a rumored cache of atium to headline-grabbing exploits in the Elendel Daily. Since the most fertile lands for adventure are deep in the dangerous Roughs, there’s every reason for a scholar, diplomat, or lawkeeper to be working alongside a gunslinger, thief, or koloss-blooded warrior. \n\n What holds these Crews together is not so much a particular way of doing things (in game terms, the Crew’s Method), as it is their objective (both their Cause and Target). Your group should think carefully about these choices when deciding on your Crew, and the Heroes’ roles within it. \n\n Stories around adventuring Crews can be very diverse affairs, encouraging them to travel far and wide and meet all sorts of interesting characters and situations.

Some may fight for the money, some may fight for glory, but for people of the frontier, these brave individuals are the thin line between order and chaos, justice and submission, right and wrong. \n\n Lawkeeper Crews are a solid “default” mode for a game set in The Alloy of Law era, thanks to an accessible premise which casts the Heroes as the good guys with a clear purpose. Out in the Roughs, nearly any man or woman willing to stand up for what’s right can be a lawkeeper, or be deputized by one, so putting a Crew together as a lawkeeper posse is an easy way to bring many diverse character concepts together under a single banner. \n\n The defining features of a lawkeeper Crew are its Target and Methods — a group that chooses to combat “Corruption” “By the Letter of the Law” will work much differently than one that chases “Bounties” using “Extreme Force.” All players should discuss what sort of lawkeepers they want to be and what’s in it for them, before settling on these essential questions of what they’re after and how they’re pursuing it. \n\n Lawkeeper stories are pretty easy for a Narrator to set up as well — just create a villain and a scenario that puts the Crew on a collision course with him, and let them take it from there. While it may be tempting to make these stories simple “find bad guy/shoot bad guy/ride off into sunset” affairs, there are many more variations on the story.

They could be bounty hunters, guns for hire, security contractors, consulting detectives, or cat’s paws in a war between two competing mining companies…bound together only by the almighty dollar. \n\n Mercenary Crews are a classic trope of the Western genre, putting the Heroes in pursuit of treasure or personal gain. Typically, these teams are made up of rough-and-tumble characters who are hired for their skill at fighting and keeping their mouths shut. Their patrons tend to be powerful groups like noble Houses or companies, but can also be smaller organizations like a town, parish, or even a family. \n\n Crews of mercenaries do not tend to have strong Causes or Targets (though “Wealth” is popular), but their Methods are central to their identity; whether the Heroes are private investigators or hired guns, their Methods are likely the reason they were hired in the first place! Expanding personal wealth should be considered a result of the Crew’s work rather than the goal itself: since the Mistborn Adventure Game doesn’t allow Heroes to hold on to looted items for very long by design, players hoping to amass giant stockpiles of notes and bars might quickly find themselves disappointed. \n\n Mercenary stories pose an interesting question. On the one hand, executing missions on behalf of a wealthy patron is easy for the tabletop RPG format; on the other, they’re kind of boring! The best stories for mercenary Heroes add an additional layer to “just following orders.” For example, a traditional twist to these tales pits the Crew’s selfish motives (personal gain) against other, loftier ideals (justice, honor, fairness) by making them face the victims or ugly realities of their employers’ goals, leaving the Heroes to ask: what is the price of our desires, and who should pay it? What do we lose of ourselves in the process? Both the players and the Narrator should always be looking for new ways to explore these questions and add emotional depth to the Crew’s exploits."

What defines all these stories is that the only path to addressing these injustices is to go outside the laws and the system that creates them. \n\n Vigilante Heroes can come from any walk of life, though most often they’re drawn from those without power or easy access to justice through the system — farmers, laborers, small-town folk, or members of a minority group being the most common seekers of satisfaction by extralegal means. Crews of these wronged folk often are formed through a mutual slight, perhaps being coworkers at the same mine, members of the same community, or survivors of the same massacred tribe. \n\n Vigilante Crews are united not by their skills or their backgrounds, but by their mutual desire for revenge against those that wronged them. Consequently, Cause is the Crew’s most important aspect (“Revenge”) followed very closely by Target (the source of the injustice). Method is a distant third, as vigilantes by definition are willing to do whatever it takes to get satisfaction. \n\n Revenge-centered stories tend to be very focused on the investigation and execution of the Crew’s plot, step by bloody step, for it’s the desire for vengeance that holds the group together.

The organization of these Crews is much like that of Kelsier’s team: a set of specialists who each play a role in their heists. \n\n For criminal Crews, Targets and Methods tend to be the most important defining choices (Target defining whom they prey upon, and Method describing how they choose to do it). Cause is not very important…it’s pretty clear that modern Scadrian criminals are more opportunistic than those of the past. \n\n Criminal stories tend to fall into one of two categories: those focusing on pulling off a series of increasingly daring heists; or those centered on the group’s illicit activities, and coping with the fallout from them (gang war, going on the run, etc.).

A missionary Crew can be composed of nearly any sort of character; aside from the obligatory preacher or true believer who acts as the head of the Crew, there could be religious scholars, bodyguards, scouts, or even reformed criminals seeking a chance at redemption. \n\n A missionary Crew is all about the Cause — bringing the light of their faith to others. Their Methods may vary wildly, as some seek peaceful conversion and others go with fire and brimstone. The Crew’s Target is likely very large, probably focusing on unbelievers, but it could also be aimed at another faith the Crew wishes to undo as part of a spiritual crusade. \n\n Missionary Crews are an unusual way to tell stories in The Alloy of Law era, mainly because there is little precedent in entertainment or in the original trilogy to refer to.

From previous discussions with the players individually, he knows the players are interested in getting the bad guys the law can’t touch, and has tentatively set the Crew’s Cause as “Bounty Hunting” and their Target as “Outlaws.” Next he asks what their Method is. \n\n Filamena and David both want to play characters who are good at fighting, while John wants to play the Crew Leader, and Jess has been thinking about a more investigative or social character. \n\n Brandon reminds the players they’ll need to think carefully about how these concepts all fit together in a comprehensive story. What would a social character do with a bunch of tough guys, chasing criminals? After a lively discussion, the group decides that the non-fighting characters would be the brains of the outfit, providing guile and subtlety when chasing tough bounties.

Brandon asks why his character became a bounty hunter. John thinks for a bit and decides that his mother fled from Elendel to the Roughs after she was caught stealing from her own family. When his Hero came of age, he went out into the Roughs to look for her. He eventually found his mother dying, her money stolen; he went on to track down her killers and found that he had a taste for bounty hunting. \n\n Jess then says that she wants to play a con artist and grifter. Brandon asks why her criminally-inclined character would join a Crew of people who mostly seem to be about catching outlaws. Jess considers and says that maybe John’s bounty hunter found the con artist before he got too far on the wrong side of the law, and offered him another use for his talents.

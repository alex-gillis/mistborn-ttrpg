# Mistborn Adventure Game Compendium
Welcome to the Mistborn Tabletop Compendium! Delve into the secrets of Scadrial with ease, whether you're a novice Mistborn or a seasoned Allomancer.

## Introduction
Planning a campaign in the world of Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series using the Mistborn Adventure Game by Crafty Games? You're in the right place. With the complexity of the Mistborn universe and the vast array of abilities and rules within the Mistborn Adventure Game, finding specific information can be like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Recognizing the need for accessible resources, I've embarked on creating this compendium to streamline the process for players and Game Masters alike. No more sifting through multiple books or scouring the web for scattered resources. Everything you need to dive into the world of Mistborn tabletop gaming is right here.

## Purpose

From character creation and rules references to setting details and gameplay mechanics, this compendium aims to provide comprehensive and easy-to-access information for players and Game Masters.

It does let a character see further through the mists, and more clearly than any ordinary human, even in dim light. So long as the character has at least a little ambient illumination — generally, anywhere but underground, in a sealed room, or in a dense forest on a cloudy night — he or she can see as well as an ordinary person during the day. \n\n Because all senses are enhanced equally, a character burning or flaring Tin is vulnerable to loud noises, sudden bright lights, and extremely strong smells.

                "lore": "A Misting who can burn Iron is called a Lurcher. \n\n Burning Iron lets an Allomancer physically Pull on metals within several dozen yards. While burning Iron, a character sees bright, transparent blue lines leading from his or her center of mass and leading out to all sources of metal within range; the further away an object is from the character, the fainter the blue lines. The character may Pull on any metal objects sensed in this fashion, and this process is commonly called “Ironpulling.” By varying the strength and speed of an Ironpull, a character may affect objects of various sizes, and also control their velocity. A skilled Pull can drag a coin slowly across a surface or hurl a metal urn at speeds approaching that of an arrow.\n\n There are several limitations to this ability. First, objects are Pulled directly towards the character’s center of mass, which is good when drawing a weapon to hand but not as helpful when others are blocking the character’s line of sight to it. Strategic Pullers might use this to their advantage, Pulling a weapon (or another object) that’s situated on the other side of an opponent, turning it into a ranged weapon. This is great until the character misses, at which point he or she becomes a target of the very same missile. Many Ironpullers carry wooden shields for this very reason. \n\n Additionally, the weight an Allomancer can move using Iron depends upon his or her own — Pulling an object that weighs as much as the character results in a pointless tug of war, while Pulling something heavier, or something anchored down in some fashion that would support the character’s weight, moves the character toward the object instead. Thus, Pulling the lock of a sturdy door would draw the character toward the door, unless the surrounding wall were somehow unstable enough that it wouldn’t support the character’s weight. \n\n Allomancers often anchor themselves by Pulling on a second larger object, or increasing their weight. Creative characters use this to maneuver, Pulling themselves up toward anchored objects and using others to guide their trajectories through the air. Careful “Pulling” can even work like relaxing a muscle, letting the character slowly drop from a metal fixture at the top of a high structure or sliding down a steep incline topped with an anchored metal object. Burning Iron can even let a character hover in midair below a sufficiently secured mooring, like a metal chain holding up a large chandelier, or the metal binding around a wooden rafter. \n\n One last restriction: virtually no Allomancer can Pull on metal that’s inside a person, or that’s driven through a body, like metal earrings or Hemalurgic spikes. The only exceptions are through Allomantic enhancements, as provided by Duralumin or Nicrosil",
                "rules": "While burning Iron, you automatically detect and may Pull either one or all metal objects within 100 paces (Medium Range). This distinction is important — you may not choose to Pull more than one object unless you Pull all of them, or you have the Multiple Targets Stunt (see page 306).\n\nIf a Pulled object is smaller or lighter than you, it’s drawn toward you; otherwise, you’re Pulled towards it. In both cases you can control velocity, up to a maximum speed of approximately 100 mph. Generally, Ironpulling requires no roll unless there’s a compelling reason the story might be enhanced with failure (the Narrator always makes this call, as he or she has the best view of all story implications). When a roll is required, it’s made with your Iron rating. \n\nA common use of Ironpulling is to attack with loose metal objects behind an enemy. When you make such an attack, you roll with your Iron rating and apply the other rules listed here: \n\n Pulling an object held or worn by another character is a Contest between your Iron and the target’s Physique. Battling for a metal object with another Allomancer is also a Contest, pitting your Iron vs. his or her Iron. In both cases, success drags the object away from the target (if it’s held) or sends the target sprawling (if the object is worn) ",

                "lore": "A Misting who can burn Steel is called a Coinshot. \n\n Burning Steel grants abilities very similar to those of Iron, with one key difference — the metal lets an Allomancer Push metal within several dozen yards directly away, rather than Pulling them in. This process is typically called “Steelpushing.” A character burning Steel also sees transparent blue lines leading from his center of mass out to every piece of metal within range, and their intensity is likewise based on their distance and size. Pushing along these lines lets the character send an unanchored object of equal or smaller weight away, or sends him or her in the other direction from an anchored or larger object. Allomancers often use this ability to fire small objects like coins at targets (hence the Misting nickname). This makes Steel the most popular form of offensive Allomancy, and puts Coinshots in high demand among noble houses and military forces alike. \n\n Pushing against anchored or larger metal objects (or smaller objects on the ground directly below the character) is a favorite mode of Allomantic travel. By dropping a coin or two on the ground and Pushing against them, a skilled Allomancer can “walk” on stilts of Allomantic force, or hover dozens of yards in the air. In the early days of the Final Empire, Allomantic highways were comprised of metal bars wedged into the ground, providing Allomancers with quick and reliable travel between Luthadel and other major cities. Of course, landing can be difficult, so many leave such stunts to Mistborn (who can absorb the punishment of any mishap with Pewter). \n\n As with Iron, Pushing on metal inside or piercing the body of another living being (like piercings and Hemalurgic spikes) is exceedingly difficult, and typically only achievable when also using an enhancement metal like Duralumin or Nicrosil. ",
                "rules": "While burning Steel, you automatically detect and may Push either one or all metal objects within 100 paces (Medium Range). This distinction is important — you may not choose to Push more than one object unless you Push all of them, or you have the Multiple Targets Stunt. \n\n If a Pushed object is smaller or lighter than you, it’s propelled away from you; otherwise, you’re Pushed away from it. In both cases you can control velocity, up to a maximum speed of approximately 100 mph. Generally, Steelpushing requires no roll unless there’s a compelling reason the story might be enhanced with failure (the Narrator always makes this call, as he or she has the best view of all story implications). When a roll is required, it’s made with your Steel rating. \n\n A common use of Steelpushing is to attack with loose metal objects between you and an enemy (e.g. the contents of a coin purse or a bag of horseshoes, which you can throw at an opponent as part of an attack). When you make such an attack, you roll with your Steel rating and apply the other rules listed below.\n\n Pushing an object held or worn by another character is a Contest between your Steel and the target’s Physique. Battling for a metal object with another Allomancer is also a Contest, pitting your Steel vs. his or her Steel. In both cases, success propels the object out of the target’s hands and away from you (if it’s held) or sends the target sprawling (if the object is worn). In the case of a metal object positioned between two Steelpushing Allomancers, the object can become a projectile targeting the loser, using the rules on the Steelpushing Attacks table. \n\n Finally, by Pushing off of metal in your environment, or metallic implements on the ground like coins or horseshoes, you may hover in midair, or “stilt-walk” or sail at up to 25 miles per hour. This is not flight, and the maximum height you can reach is equal to your Pushing range (100 paces, unless you have the Long Range Stunt). Landing can also be problematic, requiring you to Push off of metal objects thrown down onto the ground or already located there. Most landings require no roll but doing so in rough or treacherous terrain requires a successful Steel 1 roll, with failure costing you 1 Health.",

As soon as the character starts burning Copper, all signs of Allomancy within the cloud’s range instantly “vanish” from Bronze burners — including any Bronze burners in the same area. This makes a Copper burner an essential addition to any crew employing Allomancers — without concealing the pulses every Allomancer gives off while burning metal, the team is easily detected by rival Seekers, Mistborn, and Steel Inquisitors. \n\n A second useful effect of burning Copper is that it renders the character virtually immune to Allomantic emotional manipulation.

This of course makes them a vital commodity in the information-starved Final Empire. \n\n While storing memorized knowledge or events, a character has only a faint recollection of them — much like a fading dream. This is often done to keep information “fresh, committing a memory to a coppermind as soon as it’s no longer immediately useful as possible, so it can be retrieved later without having to rely on the tenuous nature of the mind. Cagey characters sometimes store damaging secrets as well — because what need is there to lie when you genuinely can’t remember something? \n\n Tapping memories lets a Feruchemist “check out” that information, like someone in our world would check out a library book. He or she recalls it precisely and with perfect clarity, as if via photographic memory, and can describe it without issue. For example, a character recalling a book could duplicate it exactly, word for word. However, this process does not improve the accuracy of the information recalled — a character who was mistaken about a person’s name still remembers it incorrectly, and because the memory is stored in a perfect and unaltered (and unalterable) the character’s impression never changes, even after countless corrections from trusted friends. \n\n The massive wealth of information stored can be difficult to track, and so many Feruchemists organize memories into different copperminds and keep detailed indices of what’s contained in each. Others reread books they’ve stored and write down rough details of their stored knowledge to use as reference when tapping their copperminds. In many ways this reinforces the library analogy, as the cracks in the system aren’t so much about the recorded information as one’s access and perception of it. \n\n The greatest peril for a Feruchemist is that one or more copperminds are lost or destroyed, as this means the memories held within are gone for good. For some characters this vulnerability is a blessing, providing an opportunity few can indulge — the chance to selectively and permanently forget painful or troubling memories — but to most it’s a desperate danger. The chance that such a prized possession might disappear forever, denying not only a life’s work but a life’s most personal legacy... It’s a terrifying proposition most Feruchemists guard against with their very lives.",

The maximum number of charges you may store in any hour is equal to your Copper rating or your Wits score minus 1, whichever is lower. \n\n Unlike most Feruchemical storage, memory does not reset when the process is complete. Stored memories remain lost until tapped, and only return whiletapped; at all other times those memories are simply gone. They may not be dredged up, even under duress. \n\nThe Narrator always has final say as to what information qualifies for storing in a coppermind.",

Any or all emotions a target is already feeling may be magnified, though Zinc is most often used to amplify only a single emotion that the character feels will best serve his or her cause, like an opponent’s fear during a duel.\n\nAn Allomancer can’t use Zinc to create new feelings in a target, only pull their existing emotions to the fore. Someone who’s bored or annoyed by a performance couldn’t be made to genuinely enjoy the show, but Zinc could ratchet up the restlessness until he or she heckles the performer or walks out.\n\nThus, a character will often seed an emotion before burning Zinc — by offering a strong enough bargain to promote greed, for example, or by appealing to an outraged person’s sense of fair play to promote calm. The stronger the emotion already is, the more effective Zinc can be in fueling its growth.\n\nZinc does not let a character detect emotions, and so burners of the metal are usually practiced students of the human condition. Careful observation and analysis of behavior are vital to successfully manipulating any target’s emotional state.\n\nLikewise, Zinc Allomancy is not mind control — a Rioted emotion is still the target’s own, it’s just more powerful, and no matter how strongly the target feels something he or she is still guided by core principles, preferences, and predilections. As an example, enflaming one person’s anger might prompt them to start a bar brawl, while doing the same in someone else might result in them traded insults, stalking off in disgust, or even finding comfort at the bottom of a bottle.\n\nEmotional Allomancy is a reality of House life, with most nobles (and all Obligators) on the lookout for possible Allomantic manipulation. Sudden, strong, or inappropriate mood shifts are telltale signs and often disregarded out of hand, just in case a Rioter or Soother is the cause. Some Allomancers use this to their advantage, tampering with an emotion they want the target to ignore. Others know the best way to achieve their goals is through subtlety and guile rather than brute force and zeal.",
                "rules": "While burning Zinc, you may amplify one or more existing emotions in a number of individuals up to your rating with the metal. You may only affect those within 10 paces (Close Range).\n\nYou may not use Zinc to detect emotions, but you may roll your Charm to do so. This is a Difficulty 1 Challenge if the target is unaware of your attempt (and therefore unable to conceal their feelings), or a Charm vs. Charm Contest if they’re aware and trying to conceal their state.\n\nYou may Riot any emotion(s) you like, but your efforts are most effective when a target emotion is already strong. Thus, the Difficulty of any Zinc roll to amplify an emotion is based on its current strength. When Rioting multiple emotions, your Difficulty is set by the weakest of them (i.e. you roll against the highest Difficulty of all the target emotions)\n\nWith success, the target emotion(s) swell and you gain one die per point of Outcome with Charm and Influence rolls against the victim, so long as you concentrate your attention on them and keep burning Zinc (see What’s the Outcome?).\n\nWith failure, the target emotion(s) aren’t stirred and the Narrator may spend two Complications to alert the target to your effort. Four Complications may be spent to identify you as the source of the manipulation (see Complications).\n\nRemember that Zinc does not grant you control of a Rioted character — it merely pulls them in one direction or another as befits their personal motivations and impulses. It’s also not always one-sided — a target aware that you’re manipulating them can oppose your Zinc rolls with their Wits or Charm, as fits their approach (in the Narrator’s estimation).\n\nou can also Riot discordant emotions — like pleasure in someone performing an unpleasant task, or guilt after a victory — and this can trip up or confuse the victim.

Like any Feruchemical transfer, identity is set at the time it’s stored, and tapping it later — especially in large amounts — can “reset” the character’s personality to that earlier version of him or herself.

In this way investiture is the most potent enhancement available in Feruchemy, a reserve of pure, universal power that can amplify nearly any Feruchemical effort. \n\n The promise of Nicrosil becomes even more astounding if you consider it in relation to one of the incredibly powerful sources of power in the Final Empire (such as the Well of Ascension or the mists). Theoretically, a character exposed to one of these might be able to transform and store its seemingly limitless power, putting near-godlike power at his or her disposal.

First, you may not tap any metalminds while storing charges in a nicrosilmind, and second, you may only ever transform charges and store from a single metalmind at any time. \n\n Should you somehow receive a boost of power from an external source, like the Well of Ascension, the mists, or Duralumin or Nicrosil Allomancy, you can transform and store it in a nicrosilmind instead of using it immediately. In this case any gained dice and bonuses to Result and/or Outcome are totaled and halved, rounding down, to determine how much investiture is stored.

This does not impact the character’s Wits score under any other circumstances. \n\n - Each time a character in the bubble takes an action against a character outside it, he or she gains a number of dice with that action equal to your Bendalloy rating. \n\n Should your bubble overlap another Bendalloy bubble, the time differential of the overlapping area is equal to the sum of both. Thus, if a bubble set to one minute outside for every 20 minutes inside overlapped with a bubble set to one minute outside for every 5 minutes inside, 25 minutes would pass in the overlapping area for every one minute in the outside world. \n\n If your bubble overlaps a Cadmium bubble, time is either faster in the overlapping area (if your time differential is higher than that of the Cadmium bubble), or slower (if the Cadmium bubble’s time differential is higher).

It was Malatium, for example, that let Vin see the Lord Ruler as he was before the Ascension, and from this she came to understand the truth about the Hero of Ages.",
                "rules": "While burning Malatium, you see spectral versions of those within your line of sight, each revealing an alternate past they might have lived. Time elapses in these visions as it does in reality — you experience one minute of each alternate past for every minute you burn Malatium in the present. There’s no limit to how far back you can peer into someone’s past using Malatium and alternate pasts appear to you with crystal clarity. \n\n The Narrator may require a Malatium roll if you wish to witness a very specific parallel (“What if he’d made this decision?” rather than “What’s another way this could have gone?”). The more specific the divergence and the further back in time it occurs, the higher the roll’s Difficulty. \n\n This Power has several interesting applications, such as learning details about the target that might not otherwise be available, seeing through deceptions he or she has established to conceal past deeds, and even modeling behavior and values from choices he or she didn’t make. As with exploring the consequences of specific divergences, a Malatium roll may be required for any of these efforts, with a Difficulty based on the same factors. ",

            "basics":"Allomancy lets a person ingest one or more metals and “burn” them to fuel various powers. While burning a metal, an Allomancer feels warmth radiating from his stomach, as if he just consumed a hot beverage or strong drink. The power granted depends on the metal burnt, and each metal burns at a different rate, depending on the power’s intensity. \n\n The vast majority of Allomancers are Mistings, who can burn only a single metal. By the last days of the Final Empire, about one in every 100 nobles, and one in every 10,000 skaa, possessed the ability to burn each metal. Rarer still are Mistborn, who comprise about one in every 100 Allomancers (or one in every 10,000 nobles), and who can burn all Allomantic metals. These special individuals are the subjects of great awe and wonder, worshipped and feared for their versatile and deadly gift. \n\n Despite its rarity, Allomancy is by far the most common of the three magic disciplines, and it’s also the only one that’s publicly known and discussed during the Lord Ruler’s thousand-year reign. By his decree, Allomancy is restricted exclusively to the nobility, and even then its use in noble circles is carefully monitored by the Obligators of the Steel Ministry. Skaa Allomancers — typically the result of illegitimate relations between nobles and skaa servants — are forbidden, and aggressively hunted by the Canton of Inquisition, and most notoriously by its elite agents, the Steel Inquisitors. This mortal danger drives many skaa Allomancers to join outlaw crews for protection and support, and many bands of thieves, rebels, and rogue scholars count at least an Allomancer or two amongst their ranks.",
            "history": "Little is known about Allomancy before the Final Empire. Some scholars believe Allomancy existed prior to the Lord Ruler’s Ascension, and that it manifested about as often as today. Others postulate the first Allomancers were the Lord Ruler’s earliest supporters, who were granted power by Lerasium taken from the Well of Ascension. It’s certain the first Allomancers were powerful Mistborn who went on to become the Empire’s first nobles, and that they passed their abilities down through the generations. The power in their blood was gradually weakened by time and interbreeding, however, until it reached the dilution seen in the modern day.\n\nOnly ten Allomantic metals are commonly known — the four physical metals (Tin, Pewter, Iron, and Steel), the four mental metals (Copper, Bronze, Zinc, and Brass), Atium, and Gold. Of these, Atium is by far the rarest and most valuable, making the state-controlled Atium supply a critical element in the finances of the Final Empire. \n\nKnowledge of other metals is either restricted or lost to the public, and the danger of “blindly” burning metals leaves very little room or inventive for experimentation. Indeed, the Steel Ministry strongly discourages experimentation, and it’s not uncommon for “progressive” metallurgists to simply vanish in the dead of night.\n\n After the Lord Ruler’s defeat metallurgists are again free to explore new Allomantic applications, sparking a wave of new discoveries. Knowledge of Aluminum is one of the first discoveries, followed shortly by Duralumin and Electrum, and as light is shed on the darkened archives and the Ministry’s vast troves of information, still other metals and uses are found all the time.",
            "ascension":"The discovery of new metals since the Final Ascension has transformed the practice of Allomancy. The most prominent and important discoveries have been of the temporal metals Bendalloy and Cadmium, which allow an Allomancer to slow or increase the passage of time around him, respectively. Nicrosil and Chromium, which greatly boost or drain Allomantic abilities in a flash, have also changed Scadrial’s magical landscape. \n\n However, no single metal has had a greater impact on modern Allomancy than Aluminum. This metal was thought to be of little use during the Final Empire era, thanks to its limited utility in draining an Allomancer’s stores (since they had to willingly burn it) and the difficulty in producing it. However, the advances in mining and refining technology has made Aluminum vastly easier to find and produce, allowing engineers to discover the metal’s greatest ability — Allomantic neutrality. Objects made from or lined with Aluminum cannot be detected or affected by a Misting’s powers, making Aluminum bullets or Aluminum-lined hats hard counters to the abilities of Coinshots, Lurchers, Rioters, and Soothers. An Aluminum-framed pistol is worth more to a gunslinger than chest full of gold — because who wants to burn Gold? \n\n One metal has been lost in the transition from the old world to the new — Atium. Atium nuggets were the body of the dark god Ruin; with the destruction of Ruin, so too was his body destroyed. Over the centuries, many intrepid adventurers have declared they’ve discovered an atium nugget, or part of the Lord Ruler’s ancient atium cache, but to date every claim has proven to be hogwash. But would Harmony really take something away from the world, when he’s worked to preserve so much? There’s always another secret…",

Some metals, like Tin and Pewter, add the rating to an existing Attribute or Standing, while others, like Steel and Iron, are rolled as pools for various uses and when performing particular tasks.",

They feel a radiating warmth from their stomach when they do this, as if they’d just consumed something hot or spirited. \n\n Burning is effectively instantaneous and doesn’t impact what the character can do during a Beat, even during a Conflict. Burning gradually consumes the character’s reserve of a metal, and so long as that reserve remains the character continues to benefit as described in each metal’s chapter (these begin with Chapter 6: Tin, on page 295). Once the reserve runs out, the character loses access to that power until more of the metal is ingested. \n\n An Allomancer can generally only burn metal while conscious. Characters with more than one Power may burn one, some, or all of their ingested metals, in any combination they wish.",
            "charges": "An Allomancer’s reserve of each metal is measured in “charges.” Most Allomancers refill their metal stores by drinking vials filled with a mixture of metal shavings and an ounce of liquid like water or wine. The metals in these vials depend upon their owner: Misting vials having more shavings of a single metal, while Mistborn vials have a cocktail of all eight Physical and Mental metals, though less of each (see page 237). A typical Allomancer carries several on these vials with him, but they can be lost or destroyed during rough and tumble brawls, or consumed during periods of extended burning. In such times, any sufficiently pure piece of the appropriate metal will suffice. \n\n Here are some examples of the charges an Allomancer may draw from ingesting pure metals: \n\n",

These scores do not rise again until the metal is completely burned off. In the rare event that this drops the character’s Physique to 0, the character falls unconscious and dies in the next several minutes without assistance (a successful Wits 3 roll). \n\n Additionally, any metals also can become poisonous if they linger in an Allomancer’s system too long (whether they’re pure or not). When a charge of metal is not completely burned off within eight hours of ingestion, the Allomancer loses 1 Health per unburned charge from toxic shock. This can drop a character’s Health to 0, in which case he or she falls unconscious and dies in the next several minutes without assistance (a successful Wits 3 roll). \n\n An impure metal cannot be flared",
            "burnrate":"Not all metals burn at the same rate — more potent metals, like Atium or Pewter, tend to burn much more quickly than others like Copper or Tin. A metal’s “burn rate” is the time it takes an Allomancer to fully digest (consume) a single charge. \n\n An Allomancer can boost his potency with a metal Power by “flaring,” which temporarily increases the character’s rating with the metal by 1. This rapidly consumes the character’s charges, however, increasing the metal’s burn rate to 10 times normal (i.e. each charge flares in 1/10 the metal’s normal burn time).

            "stunts": "Allomancers can augment or alter their ability through “Stunts,” which are tricks and special skills particular to each metal. For example, a Soother can quell the emotions of a single target without any special training, but with the Affect Crowd Stunt he or she can calm multiple targets at once. \n\n Stunts are gained by spending Advancements, at a cost of 4 Advancements each (see page 121). Stunts vary by metal, and are described in each metal’s chapter later in the Treatise. An Allomancer may learn any number of Stunts for his or her metals, but each Stunt may only be gained once for each metal, unless otherwise noted in the Stunt’s description. \n\n A character who gains Allomantic Power(s) from a Hemalurgic spike may learn Stunts for those Powers, even though the corresponding ratings may not be improved. Should the character ever lose the spike(s) that grant a Power, however, he or she also loses access to any corresponding Stunts until and unless the same spike is regained. \n\n A few Stunts grant temporary Traits that may be applied to related tasks (see pages 74 and 139), but only while the character is burning or flaring the metal in question. These Stunts are identified with the word “Trait” in parentheses following their names.",
            "savants": "By constantly developing skill with a single metal, highly gifted Mistings can reach the pinnacle of Allomantic power, becoming a “Misting Savant.” The process of awakening as a Savant is demanding: a Misting constantly burns and frequently flares metals through most waking hours. After several months of this, he or she may trigger the change, though the Narrator may always veto it on the grounds that it isn’t supported by the current story or isn’t appropriate for the character. \n\nWith Narrator approval, a Misting with a Power rating of 7+ may spend 10 Advancements to become a Savant, gaining two “free” Nudges with each roll of his or her Power.\n\nSadly, such prolonged exposure to Allomantic forces fundamentally changes the Misting, and many suffer health problems or addiction-like symptoms that are only relieved by using their Power. As a result, most Savants suffer one or more penalties while not burning, as described in each metal chapter.\n\nBecoming a Savant shouldn’t just ‘happen’ because you have a few extra Advancements lying around. The Mistborn Adventure Game is a story- and character-driven system, and your Hero is likely to spend many gaming sessions buying all the metal needed to fuel the process, and many more Breathers burning and flaring it all before he or she is eligible for the change. \n\nIdeally, a Hero should make the decision to become a Savant based on his or her particular motivations — like Tragedy and Destiny. A grand failure feeding the determination to become better with metal, for example, is possibly strong enough, if it makes sense in your game’s story. \n\n I would also suggest tweaking your Hero’s personality a bit as he or she makes the transition. Becoming a Savant isn’t like “leveling up” — your Hero has undergone a life-changing transformation, and that should be represented in demeanor as well as ability.",
            "mistings": "Allomancy has changed significantly since the time of the Final Empire. The Mistborn have faded into the mists of legend, along with the notion that anyone can harness the full spectrum of Allomantic power. Those with Allomantic gifts no longer conceal their abilities from sight, but use their powers openly in everyday life for the betterment of themselves and their world. Publications and tutors teach young Allomancers how to burn metals properly and precisely, and pure metals and alloys are widely available for a reasonable price. Allomancy has created and transformed The Alloy of Law era, with Mistings (and their Twinborn cousins) reaping the benefits.",
            "society":"Allomancy is the most predominant Metallic Art of the modern day. Of all types of magic, Allomancy is the best known and most trusted, mainly because its benefits tend to be both obvious and tangible — anyone can understand that Allomancy can be used to pick up a massive crate, influence a skeptical listener, or launch oneself into the air. \n\n Allomancy is also the most common of the Metallic Arts, with one person in 50 possessing Allomantic abilities. The use of Allomancy is common enough that Mistings are considered just a different type of gifted individual, and their magic is just as special as particularly high intelligence, personal charisma, or technical affinity. Those Mistings of means typically seek formal training in the use of their powers, either by private tutor or through apprenticeship, and many wealthier secondary schools and universities offer formal programs to help young Allomancers get the most from their gifts. \n\n  Many Mistings put their Allomantic powers to work in their careers, whether in labor, business, academia, or politics, and nearly anyone with the metals and the money can find a specialist that meets their needs. On the high steel of the skyscrapers rising inexorably from the Elendel skyline, skilled Lurcher engineers work tirelessly to move supplies and supports into place without worrying about falling to their deaths. When a new mine opens up, Tineye surveyors are the first inside to explore for dangerous terrain, gas leaks, and potential collapse. In the constabulary, Soothers act to quell riots and civil disputes alike, while in industrial shops they find employment as strike-breakers and “workplace satisfaction consultants.” Rioter activists flare emotions of crowds in support of their candidates or causes, while in the criminal underworld they Pull forth feelings of fear, intimidation, and reservation in their employer’s victims. Electrum-burning stock brokers use their metals to predict and capitalize on minute changes in the market. If there’s a place that an Allomancer can make life safer, easier, or more affordable, someone is willing to pay to have a Misting there, burning their metals. \n\n Not all Mistings choose to turn their gifts to a profit — in fact, a fair number of Allomancers choose not to reveal their abilities at all. The reasons these Mistings choose not to do so are myriad. Sometimes hiding a power is simply a matter of personal shame, if for instance one’s power seems inferior or useless. At other times, powers might be concealed to protect a family’s reputation, as when a Misting is born to a family line that does not have any Allomancers. At still others, Mistings hide their powers in order to protect a political or business advantage, such as a Smoker, Rioter, or Soother hidden amongst political staff or a Leecher or Oracle bodyguard. \n\n The choice to conceal Allomantic abilities is entirely personal; there are no laws on the books requiring anyone to disclose whether or not one is metalborn. Nevertheless, the specter of Misting registration remains a never-ending political issue, raised in the guise of upholding “public safety” or the “common good.” In governmental meetings and letters to the newspapers, hypothetical horror stories of Coinshot peeping toms watching through your second-story window, or Pewterarm goons who casually intimidate folk are trotted out as examples of possible Misting threats to Harmony-fearing men and women everywhere. \n\n Though these far-fetched tales rarely play out, those who keep their abilities private sometimes face backlash if and when their Allomantic gifts are revealed, even in the more cosmopolitan communities of Elendel’s academic and well-to-do sets. Friendships may be abandoned; business contracts lost; political alliances dissolved; or access to family resources revoked. Despite the vast steps Mistings have made in gaining acceptance in the world since the times of the Lord Ruler, people still only trust Mistings until they uncover one where they weren’t expecting him."

            "id": 1,
            "name": "Feruchemy",
            "basics": "Feruchemy is a gift of the Terris people, who hail from the northern reaches of the Final Empire. It lets a practitioner, known as a Feruchemist, use certain metals as a storage medium for various traits and capabilities (like strength, speed, or luck). These stores can be released (or “tapped”) at a later time, and often grant explosive or superhuman ability well beyond the limits of Allomancy. For example, tapping speed can make a Feruchemist much faster, while tapping strength can make him vastly strong and tapping luck can make him wildly fortunate. \n\n Objects used to store and tap are called metalminds, and only the Feruchemist who stores a trait or capability in a metalmind can tap it. Also, the process is not quick. Consequently, a Feruchemist must often do without part or even most ability for a significant period of time to build sufficient reserves for the most impressive boosts. For example, a Feruchemist looking for just one burst of increased strength might have to store it for days, all the while being far weaker than usual. The same is true for any ability — storing keen sight might blur the Feruchemist’s vision, storing health might seriously depress his immune system and slow his healing, storing wakefulness might leave him drowsy, and so on. \n\n Feruchemy can potentially offer much greater power than Allomancy, as it lets a character tap stored characteristics much faster than they were stored. Tapping great strength in a single moment could, for example, let a Feruchemist tear open an iron gate with his or her bare hands, just as tapping great sight could render objects crystal clear over vast distances. Unfortunately, these extreme levels of power cannot be maintained for long — traits and capabilities stored over weeks might be exhausted in just a few minutes, or even in a single burst when needed.",
            "history": "By the final days of the Final Empire, knowledge of Feruchemy is all but totally lost — in fact, few outside the Terris Dominance are even aware the discipline exists at all. This is due in large part to a millennium-long suppression campaign by the Lord Ruler and agents of his Steel Ministry, who are charged with wiping out all evidence that Feruchemy ever existed. What little knowledge remains today is found in either the great archives of the Canton of Inquisition or with the Terris Keepers, and it’s closely guarded by both. \n\n Even to those aware of Feruchemy’s existence, its history remains spotty. It’s been part of Terris culture since before the Lord Ruler’s Ascension, though it was once far more common among the Terris people. As the Final Empire was established, most of the world’s most powerful Feruchemists vanished and the Lord Ruler isolated their homeland, crushing their religion and making them second-class citizens. Most heinously, he created a breeding program that enslaved women and gelded men, all with a single, nefarious purpose in mind — wiping Feruchemy from the world. \n\n This savage suppression has drastically diminished the number of Feruchemists in Scadrial, but it’s also given rise to a new and vital faction — the Keepers of the Terris Synod. Based on the Terris Worldbringers who lived before the Lord Ruler’s ascension, the Keepers are a secret sect of Feruchemists trained both in the use of their powers and with the intense study of a single subject like history, religion, or politics. They’re charged with quietly watching and recording the changing world, and keeping its knowledge safe for the future, usually in Feruchemical copperminds. The Keepers prepare this knowledge to pass on when the Lord Ruler eventually falls, and in the wake of his defeat it’s they who drag the Terris culture back from the brink of annihilation.",
            "ascension": "Much like Terris culture, Feruchemy is in the midst of a golden age. Ferrings are nearly as numerous as Allomancers; while this doesn’t make them common by any stretch of the imagination, it does mean the Terris legacy of Feruchemy, and the blood that carries it, is more well-known and accepted than ever before. \n\n The discovery of new Allomantic metals has affected the landscape of Feruchemy as well. Foremost of these are what Ferrings refer to as the Spiritual Metals (known as the Enhancement Metals in Allomancy) — Aluminum, Duralumin, Chromium, and Nicrosil. Unknown and unused by Feruchemists during the Lord Ruler’s reign, the abilities these metals offer are astounding — the ability to store and tap identity, connection to others, luck, and investiture…raw magical energy. Feruchemical scholars are still exploring the applications and consequences of these abilities, and many more brash young Ferrings are experimenting and exploiting them in the field. ",
            "mechanical": "Unlike Allomancers, Feruchemists don’t gain charges by consuming metals; rather, they store charges in metal objects called metalminds, which can be rings, bracers, earrings, or even larger pieces of metal in the game world, like pillars, natural nodes, or thrones. These charges can later be tapped, in small increments that last longer or in massive bursts that allow for superhuman feats. In this sense Feruchemy is a “closed loop;” while it potentially lets a Feruchemist achieve things an Allomancer never could, it often requires weeks, months, or even years to store up that much power. \n\n A Feruchemist must be in direct contact with a metalmind to store charges in it, or to tap those charges. For this reason many metalminds are jewelry, but any metal object of sufficient purity will work. Each metal stores only one characteristic or ability, as noted in the metal chapters later in this Book. \n\n A Feruchemist may only ever use his own metalminds, as the characteristics and abilities he stores and taps must be his own. Storing and tapping are willful acts, and may only be performed while the Feruchemist is conscious.\n\nAs with Allomancy, a character’s Feruchemical Power with each metal is rated from 1 to 10, which represents his storing and tapping ability with corresponding metalminds (1 being barely competent and 10 being incredibly skilled). This rating determines the rate at which the Feruchemist can store in and tap from corresponding metalminds:\n\n - Storing: The maximum number of charges a Feruchemist may store in a metalmind per hour is equal to his rating with that metal. The maximum number of charges a Feruchemist may store is determined by the size of his or her metalmind.\n\n - Tapping: The maximum number of charges a Feruchemist may tap from a metalmind per action is equal to his rating × 10 with that metal.\n\n We recommend tracking the charges in each Hero’s metalminds on separate lines of his or her character sheet for ease of reference.",

            "startRate": "You’ll find that a character with Powers from the outset (i.e. one who commits a strength, as mentioned in the first bullet above) is typically more powerful than one who gains  Powers later. This is thanks to the training and practice he or she has already had before the start of the story.",
            "spendAdv": "A Feruchemist may spend Advancements to increase his or her rating with each metal (see page 123). Note however that there are no Stunts for Feruchemists, and that while a character may gain one or more Feruchemical Powers from Hemalurgic spikes, he or she can never improve those Powers’ ratings", 
            "storing": "To store characteristics or abilities, a Feruchemist must be conscious and in direct contact with a metalmind composed of the appropriate metal and purity. Again, the Feruchemist’s ability with whatever he or she stores is weakened until the storing process is complete, and the more the Feruchemist stores in an hour the weaker he or she is during that time. \n\n Most of the time storing is detrimental — the Feruchemist becomes weaker, sickly, near-sighted, amnesiac, and so on — but in some rare cases it can be beneficial (like storing weight when falling or balancing on a rickety rope bridge). \n\n While storing charges, a Feruchemist is affected as described in the corresponding metal’s chapter. A Feruchemist may store any number of characteristics and abilities at a time, so long as he or she has the appropriate metalminds, but no characteristic or ability may be reduced to nothing as a result of storing. The specific limits for this are also described in each metal’s chapter, as each is a little different. \n\n For each full hour a Feruchemist spends storing, a number of charges are added to the metalmind equal to the character’s rating with that metal, or up to the limit described in each metal’s chapter, whichever is lower. Only full hours spent storing are counted, and if the Feruchemist is halted or interrupted for any reason, no charges are gained. This means that a Feruchemist can’t, for example, stop storing for the duration of a fight and then return to the process). He or she can, however, change from hour to hour if desired. \n\n Scores reduced while storing can severely impact a character’s chance of success with associated tasks and greatly magnify the cost of failure. \n\n Remember to roleplay this. A Feruchemist storing attributes should act, play, and interact differently than one who isn’t. Storing isn’t just a procedure disconnected from the person, but a fundamental change in who they are. When portraying this in the game, pull back a bit and ask yourself what an entirely different character with the altered score(s) might be like, and apply the answer(s) in your descriptions.",
            "breathers": "Breathers are “off screen” time when actions and events are largely glossed over so everyone can skip forward to the next moment that’s important to the story. Breathers often cover routine or mundane tasks — the stuff you don’t want to waste real world time roleplaying — and so Feruchemists can’t devote them entirely to storing. \n\n The maximum charges a Feruchemist may store depend on the length of the Breather: \n\n Short Breather: The maximum number of charges a Feruchemist may store in a Short Breather is equal to 10 × his or her normal maximum, as described in the previous section. \n\n Long Breather: The maximum number of charges a Feruchemist may store in a Long Breather is equal to 30 × his or her normal maximum, as described in the previous section. \n\n This is true no matter how much time the Breather actually represents in the game world. It keeps the game simple and balanced, and ensures no one abuses the system with arguments of “reality.”",
            "capacity": "The maximum number of charges a metalmind can store depends on its physical size. Unless otherwise cleared with the Narrator and supported by strong story, a typical metalmind — one gained as a Prop — is of “average” size, and can therefore store up to 100 charges.",

                }
            ],
            "tapping": "To tap previously stored characteristics or abilities, a Feruchemist must be conscious and in direct contact with the metalmind he or she wishes to tap (again, a Feruchemist may only store in and tap his own metalminds, never anyone else’s). As while storing, a Feruchemist undergoes noticeable changes when tapping. For example, a Feruchemist tapping strength may grow more muscular, and one tapping sight may gain tunnel vision and possibly vertigo. The more charges are tapped at once, the more noticeable these changes become. \n\n A Feruchemist may choose to tap anytime he or she takes an action or makes a roll. When a single action involves multiple rolls, the Feruchemist must tap independently for each roll — he or she cannot tap once when dragging a large object, for example, and gain the benefits for each roll made to drag the object part of the distance. Nor can a Feruchemist tap once and gain the benefits for all rolls made in an Extended Contest. \n\n The maximum number of stored charges that may be tapped for each action or roll is equal to 10 × the Feruchemist’s rating with that metal. A Feruchemist may tap any number of metalminds at a time, though only one of each metal for any action or roll. Tapped charges are immediately consumed, even if the current action or roll fails. \n\nTapping can dramatically increase the size of a dice pool, granting extra Nudges if it rises over 10 dice",
            "tenMore": "A Feruchemist can also tap ten or more charges at once for a spectacular effect. For example, tapping ten or more charges of Pewter (strength) might let a Feruchemist dead-lift a horse, knock over a loaded wagon, or even tear a castle gate from its hinges! \n\n For every 10 charges tapped, the Outcome of the Feruchemist’s action or roll improves by 1 (to a maximum Outcome of 6). Charges tapped in this fashion do not also grant the other effects listed for the metal (like adding dice for certain rolls), and the player must always declare that he or she is tapping 10 or more charges before any roll is made or any Outcome is described.",
            "nudge": "Finally, a Feruchemist may tap charges to increase the speed, accuracy, or effectiveness of his efforts. \n\n By tapping 5 charges, the Feruchemist may add 1 Nudge to a related action or roll. As with tapping 10 or more charges at once, the player must declare that he or she is using this option before any roll is made or any Outcome is described. \n\n When tapping 5 charges, a character does not gain any other effects listed for the metal. \n\n Remember that storing can be as useful as tapping. It’s second nature for many Feruchemists, for example, to store hearing when confronted with a loud noise (though the Narrator may sometimes ask for a Wits or other roll to do so, especially if the noise is a surprise). Likewise, storing weight makes you lighter, which can be tremendously helpful in a fall. \n\n In most cases, the utility of storing is narrower than tapping, but a clever Feruchemist always keeps an eye out for ways to use both to his or her advantage",
            "ferrings":"During the World of Ash, the only Feruchemists were the secretive Keepers, who could use all of the Feruchemical metals. In this dark era, brave and dedicated Terris found methods to subvert the Lord Ruler’s brutal breeding program in ways that allowed them to make certain that Keeper bloodlines continued and were kept pure. However, all of that ended with the Lord Ruler’s death. \n\n In the post-Origin world, Terrisfolk (and by extension, Feruchemists) were allowed to once again mingle, marry, and have children with whomever they chose, and in so doing, spread the Feruchemical bloodlines into the general population. As the power spread, so did it dilute, leading to Feruchemists who could only store or tap a single ability: Ferrings (as well as the rise of Twinborn, who can use a single Allomantic and Feruchemical power).",
            "society":"By the time of The Alloy of Law, a majority of people have at least trace amounts of Terris ancestry and potential to become Ferrings. Overall, about one person in 50 develops Feruchemical abilities, but that number rises sharply among people with significant Terris ancestry, particularly the Terris communities of the Basin and the enclaves of the mountains. \n\n Like Allomancy, Feruchemy is regarded as a natural talent and part of everyday life by most; while many people envy the powers possessed by Ferrings, they don’t consider these powers to be particularly strange or mysterious. People in the modern day understand the basics of Feruchemy far better than those of the Final Empire, including the principles of storing and tapping, and the basics of the physical and cognitive Feruchemical metals. However, scholarship around the more exotic or ancient types of Feruchemy remains confined to the Terris community — primarily amongst the continuing tradition of the Keepers. \n\n The abilities of Feruchemists make them prized employees in a wide field of professions. Archivist and Sparker Ferrings are popular accountants, secretaries, and clerks, thanks to their infallible memories and great mental agility. Sleepless Sentry Ferrings can often find employment as watchmen or guards, while Brutes have an easy time finding work in construction or as heavies for crime bosses. Connector Ferrings find law and politics natural fits to their skills, and Spinners often try their luck at the gambling table. Subsumers, Gaspers, Firesouls, and Pinnacles are often found on the frontier, where their gifts let them face the unknown with confidence. \n\n However, the limitations of Feruchemy — that one must first store an ability in order to tap it for a short time — restrict how much a Ferring can rely upon his or her powers in daily life. Jobs which utilize their gifts cannot rely upon them to perpetually use them, unlike Mistings (who simply need a steady supply of metal to keep at it). For example, a Sparker salesman is likely to reserve his stored mental speed for only the most challenging clients because every few minutes of quick-thinking brilliance requires several days of dull and plodding thought. Consequently, many employers build in “storing breaks” during the work day to allow a Ferring to build up necessary attributes and only call upon them to tap stored abilities when it is necessary. \n\n Outside of work, Ferrings tend to be more private about their abilities because the personal nature of those powers can cause others to be skeptical of the Feruchemist’s natural abilities and motives. For example, one may question how smart a Sparker or Archivist truly is without her metalminds, whether a Connector with a great number of friends would have them if not for his powers, or if a successful gambler is abusing a chromiummind to win. Like all other people, Ferrings would prefer to be judged not on the existence of their powers but the content of their character, and so when and to whom they reveal their abilities is a personal choice. \n\n Still, some Ferrings have learned to play up their powers to their social advantage. For instance, a Trueself politician or activist might play up his powers of identity to prove his bona fides as a person of strident and unbending morals, while a Pinnacle negotiator may sell his stored determination as a key to winning his clients whatever they want. The ways and hows Ferrings can use their abilities to gain advantages are as numerous and diverse as the people themselves.",

            "terris":"As the birthright of the Terris people, Feruchemy remains a very important part of Terris ethnic identity. Almost 1 in 25 people within the Terris enclaves are Ferrings — about twice the rate of those in greater society. As such, Ferrings have become an instrumental part of day-to-day life within the enclaves, often to the point of being a replacement for the higher technologies practiced in the cities. Possession of Feruchemical gifts within the Terrisfolk is both a point of pride and a call to service, and some Ferrings in those groups consider themselves to be inherently “more Terris” than people who don’t share their gifts. Though Keepers and other leaders of the Terris community do their best to discredit and speak out against such attitudes, Ferrings can often turn their status to their advantage when need be. \n\n Scadrial’s greatest expertise about Feruchemy today resides with the ancient order of the Terris Keepers. With the fall of the Lord Ruler and remaking of the world, the Keepers have turned most of their efforts from preserving historical and social events to acting as the stewards of Feruchemical knowledge. Like their predecessors, these Archivist (Copper) Ferrings use their copperminds to collect and store everything they can discover about Feruchemy for future generations. Their efforts have not gone unrewarded: those Keepers who study Feruchemy have a much more detailed understanding of all sixteen Feruchemical metals and are the best source of information on the uses of the spiritual and hybrid metals. \n\n The Keepers also act as diplomats, working with Feruchemists to ensure the gift is used for the good of the entire Terris community and the world. Some, for example, call upon known Connector or Spinner Ferrings to use their extraordinary powers of relationships or luck to improve the survival of an enclave in peril, while others work to arrange marriages between Ferrings to see that the gift is passed on to the next generation. When Ferrings act out within a Terris community, a Keeper might be assigned to work with local law enforcement or government to bring the rogue in or make sure his or her actions do not reflect poorly upon Terris society as a whole. Naturally, all these duties are kept private; discretion remains a prized trait within the sect.",
            "full":"The weakening of Allomantic ability over time has been well-documented since the World of Ash, when Mistborn went from being the primary type of Allomancer to quite rare at the time of the Lord Ruler. However, the virtual disappearance of “full” Feruchemists has baffled scholars and philosophers alike. Most believe it is simply that the Feruchemical gift will follow the same pattern of Allomancy, growing weaker and more rare over time; some spiritually-minded sorts postulate that Feruchemical ability is breaking down because Allomancy is the gift of the Survivor, able to weather the mixing of blood; and a growing contingent of scientists speculate that it is the introduction of Allomancy into the bloodlines of the Terris that has disrupted the gift of complete Feruchemy. Should this latter theory be correct, it stands to reason that a person of pure and unadulterated Terris heritage might be capable of developing full Feruchemical ability. If such a person does exist, the secretive folk of the Terris enclaves have yet to say…",
            "personality":"Feruchemy is about balance in all things. Since Ferrings must first store traits they wish to use, Feruchemy is inherently more limited than Allomancy. However, it also has one great advantage over Allomancy — the only limit that Ferrings have on the number of charges they can use is the number of charges they have stored in their metalminds. Even the most powerful Thug can barely lift a pony, while a Pewter Ferring with a sufficient number of charges could lift a locomotive. The degree of power possible with Feruchemy can be awe-inspiring, but also necessarily brief. \n\n This balance of storing and tapping means that Ferrings consider themselves to be more thoughtful and careful than Allomancers — they cannot use their powers willy-nilly! Although using any of the physical metals is direct and obvious, even a Pewter or Steel Ferring must still consider how many of their limited number of charges they are willing to use. Maintaining a large store of charges requires forethought, dedication, and sacrifice. \n\n Some Feruchemists, especially those who were raised in the Terris community, believe that Allomancy makes its practitioners lazy and careless, while Feruchemy encourages wisdom, careful deliberation, and an appreciation of the cost of power. Some Ferrings who can use one of the cognitive metals, especially Copper and Zinc, also believe that they can use their metal because they possess superior intelligence — despite the lack of any obvious connection between Feruchemical ability and intelligence."

            "name": "Hemalurgy",
            "basics": "Hemalurgy is the least known, least understood discipline in the Final Empire, practiced almost exclusively at the highest levels of the Steel Ministry. It involves using a metal spike to kill someone, thus stealing one of their characteristics or abilities (and coincidentally, absorbing a piece of the person’s soul in the process). The victim’s death seals the characteristic or ability in the spike, which can then be driven into another person’s body to pass the stolen trait to them. \n\n The size of a Hemalurgic spike can vary widely, and it’s unrelated to the power it contains. The largest (like those found in Steel Inquisitors) can be many inches in length and up to an inch in diameter, while the smallest are no bigger than a sewing needle or a pierced earring. Even when one of these spikes pierces a vital organ like the eyes or heart, it poses no danger unless it’s removed. \n\n A spike must be large enough to kill someone (obviously), but it need not be all of an object used to kill. The tip of a sword that pierces someone in just the right location could become a Hemalurgic spike, for example. \n\n The characteristic or ability stolen by a spike depends on its metal composition. A Steel spike, for instance, steals a Physical Allomantic Power, while a Tin spike steals one of the victim’s senses. As might be evident, this makes Hemalurgic spikes the only way an Allomancer can gain Feruchemy. \n\n Creating a spike is difficult, as the metal must be sufficiently pure and prepared to exacting standards. Using a spike is just as tricky, as incorrect placement and method can completely undermine the process. Sadly, knowledge of these arts has been suppressed for so long as to be largely unknown outside the Steel Ministry. \n\n Also, the incredible power of Hemalurgy is unnatural and takes a great toll. Abilities granted by spikes are essentially shards of another person’s spirit — one that can scramble, weaken, and even pervert the recipient’s will. Worse, spikes that steal characteristics common to all people — like strength, intelligence, or senses — can cause more dramatic corruption, often twisting the body as well as the spirit.",
            "creations": "Arrays of spikes used in combination can even create entirely new beings — most notably the koloss, the kandra, and the Steel Inquisitors. These Hemalurgic creations were once something else, but have since become new species divorced from their forebears by corrupting magic that defines and reshapes them. \n\n Fair Warning: This section contains spoilers for the original Mistborn trilogy. Read at your own risk.",
            "koloss": "Koloss are humans pierced by four iron spikes, often as punishment for rebellion, treason, or sedition. These spikes transform the unfortunate recipients in hideous and inhuman ways — their bodies become incredibly strong, their skin turns blue, their memories fade, and their minds descend into a cycle of boredom, hunger, and rage. Once the transformation is complete, koloss are pressed into service as shock troops, employed in merciless assaults against the Lord Ruler’s enemies. \n\n Koloss continue to grow in height and mass throughout “life,” and those not killed in battle eventually die as their hearts literally burst. Koloss society is a mockery of human culture, built around the rule of might makes right, and fueled by an economy of violence. Only a powerful Allomancer can direct a koloss horde effectively, and so Steel Inquisitors are often at the center of any coordinated koloss action. ",
            "kandra": "Kandra are mistwraiths enhanced by a pair of metal spikes collectively called a “Blessing.” This raises the mistwraith from its mindless existence and also grants new abilities: improved senses from the Blessing of Awareness, enhanced strength and speed from the Blessing of Potency, augmented intelligence and memory from the Blessing of Presence, or enhanced emotional stability from the Blessing of Stability. \n\n Unlike koloss, the kandra breed true and have a complex society, hidden far from human eyes. Most interaction with humans is arranged through a Contract, and paid for in precious atium. Kandra are also vulnerable to control via emotional Allomancy, and go to great lengths to hide this fact from humans. \n\n Kandra hold the Lord Ruler in very high regard, referring to him as “The Father,” though very few speak of their relationship to him.", 
            "inquisitor": "Most powerful of all Hemalurgic creations are the Steel Inquisitors — humans whose bodies have been enhanced by eleven or more Hemalurgic spikes, most notably the twin Steel spikes driven through their eye sockets. Inquisitors possess an amazing collection of abilities — Allomancy, Feruchemy, and other enhancement — making them the most powerful beings in Scadrial, after the Lord Ruler himself.",
            "inqDiagram": "../assets/inqDiagram.png",
            "history": "The history and origins of Hemalurgy are completely unknown. There are no records of it before the Lord Ruler’s Ascension, and it’s possible he created the art when he came to power. It may alternately have been discovered prior to the Lord Ruler’s rise, perhaps by accident when a spike of the correct metal impaled someone in just the right spot. Obviously someone got past the horror and disgust of the process, valuing the power it conveyed enough to look past the cost in human life and suffering. \n\n Following the Lord Ruler’s Ascension Hemalurgy was treated as a state secret, revealed only to trusted members of the Steel Ministry. The Lord Ruler used Hemalurgy quite frequently, to produce the Steel Inquisitors, his koloss armies, and the mysterious kandra, but the details of it were kept from everyone else — even the heads of the highest ranking noble families. \n\n The Lord Ruler’s fall would doubtlessly remove some of these boundaries, but the horrifying nature of the art, the precision required for its use, and its incredible toll on one’s humanity, are likely to stymie most forays into its potential.",
            "ascension": "It should come as little surprise that the bloody art of Hemalurgy has waned in the modern day; with the fall of Ruin and the Steel Ministry — the primary practitioners of Hemalurgy in the Final Empire — there are few who understand its complex and corrupting practice. Harmony said nothing of the art in the Words of Founding, and if anyone knows how the art works…they’re not talking. Hemalurgic spikes can still be found in the bodies of full koloss and the Faceless Immortals, but all are relics from the World of Ash and treasured by those whose lives depend upon their preservation. \n\n This is not to say that Hemalurgy is definitely gone, however — merely that knowledge of its intricacies and side effects are lost. And as with any mystery, there are those whose curiosity, greed, or thirst for adventure may drive them to search for the answer. Harmony help those who find them.",
            "mechanical": "There are two types of Hemalurgic spikes — the traditional spikes used to steal and transfer from one person to another, and the kandra’s Blessings. In both cases the specific effects of using the spike are based on its metal composition. \n\n Some spikes have a Power rating of 2 to 10, and others simply have a simple effect or grant a single ability with no rating. When Hemalurgy has a rating, it represents the strength of the characteristic or ability transferred. \n\n Once a traditional spike is correctly driven into a character, he or she can use the characteristics and/or abilities it grants, and all rules that applied before they were stolen also apply to the new owner. Thus, a character who gains an Allomantic Power from a spike may ingest the corresponding metal to gain charges, and burn or flare those charges at will, while a character who gains a Feruchemical Power may store charges in a metalmind and tap them later, both using all the rules in the previous two chapters. \n\n Because abilities stolen with Hemalurgy are actually someone else’s, a character who gains Feruchemy may use metalminds that belonged to the person killed by the spike (as the character is, quite literally, using that person’s power). \n\n The effects of Blessings are described in the kandra section.",
            "options": [
                {
                    "option": "When building a Hero, a player can begin play with Blessings if a kandra"

                }
            ],
            "startRate": "The rating of each spike, or set of spikes, is noted where it’s gained, and this rating may never improve. The characteristics and/or abilities in each spike are stolen from someone else, and forever set at their development at the time of death. \n\n A character with one or more spikes may still learn Stunts for any transferred Powers that have them, since those are developed through experience and training. Should a spike ever be removed, however, the character loses access to all associated Stunts until and unless he ever regains the same spike. \n\n You can’t just drive a spike in anywhere. Placement is a tricky process, even with an inkling of where it should go in the body. It’s similar to surgery — you might know that someone’s stomach hurts, and you might even know that it’s appendicitis, but actually removing an appendix requires years of training and practice. I suggest that if a Crew finds a spike or three and wants to use them, they should undertake a story-driven quest for a detailed explanation of how to place those particular spikes, or someone who can place them, before anyone should be allowed to spend Advancements to gain their benefits.",
            "combining": "Spikes can enhance a character’s pre-existing Powers, providing a quick but dangerous shortcut to extraordinary power. This is most effective with Allomancy, as demonstrated by Zane’s incredible skill with Steel and the uncanny Bronze Allomancy of Inquisitors in the novels. \n\n When an Allomancer gains a spike granting ability with a metal he can already use, his rating with that metal increases by the spike’s rating. If this increases the rating above 10, any extra is converted to Nudges when the character rolls with the Power. \n\n By contrast, spikes are much less useful to Feruchemists. When a Feruchemist gains a spike granting Feruchemy, he or she gains no benefit other than possible access to metalminds belonging to whomever the Feruchemy was stolen from. This is, in fact, the only way one Feruchemist can use the metalminds of another. ",
            "drawback": "The horrific nature of the Hemalurgic arts, and the physical, mental, and spiritual conflicts they incite, gradually warp the body, mind, and soul of anyone who benefits from them. For each spike, a character’s Wits, Charm, Spirit, or combination of the three are reduced by 1, depending on the spike’s metal, as described in each metal’s chapter later in this Treatise. Blessings are the only exception to this rule — they don’t suffer this penalty because the spikes actually create them, and are responsible for their sentience. \n\n As when any score is reduced, all derived values are also reduced. This means that a spike that reduces a character’s Charm also reduces his or her Reputation by the same amount, just as a spike that reduces Wits or Spirit also reduces Willpower. Some spikes may change a character even further, as described in each metal’s chapter later in the Treatise. \n\n Hemalurgic spikes are also a vehicle by which Ruin can communicate with and corrupt the bearer — first through hallucinations or ethereal voices but more and more directly as additional spikes are gained. Should a character’s Charm, Wits, or Spirit ever drop to 0 as a result of gaining a spike, he or she winds up an automaton of the dark god, falling under the Narrator’s control. Sadly, this means the player will have to build a new character, as his or her previous one isn’t fit for the work of Heroes anymore. \n\n Finally, Hemalurgic creations like koloss, kandra, and Steel Inquisitors can be controlled with suitably powerful emotional Allomancy, as described on page 226.",
            "using": "The process for using Hemalurgic spikes is a complete mystery outside the Steel Ministry at the time of the original Mistborn trilogy, and poorly understood even by the Lord Ruler himself. As a result, most spikes gained through Advancements or as a byproduct of your story should come with a strong story not only for how the spike is acquired but also how the knowledge for its use is obtained. \n\n Using a spike to steal a characteristic or ability involves pounding a sharp metal object of the correct metal composition and purity through a victim’s body, piercing a particular vital organ or area. If the strike is precise enough, the victim is instantly slain and a piece of his spirit is transferred to the spike. Only one characteristic or ability may be stolen from each victim, even if the victim possesses more than one that qualifies. \n\n A spike only gains a rating when the stolen characteristic or ability has one, and then the rating is 1 lower than the original characteristic or ability (minimum 2). \n\n Once imbued with power, a spike must be driven into a new body relatively soon or it starts to lose its potency. For each week a spike goes without being inserted into a new body, its rating drops by 1 (to a minimum of 2). A spike with no rating never degrades.",
            "decay": "It’s mentioned in the books that a Hemalurgic spike can become “stale” by remaining too long outside a body. The powers it grants can decay — never to the point that the spike is entirely useless, but without very special preparations a spike left outside of a body will slowly lose some of its charge and grant less and less power.",
            "removal": "Hemalurgic spikes must penetrate vital organs such as the eyes, heart, or another vital area to transfer their power, and while this doesn’t present an immediate danger when a spike is first driven in, removing one can be severely traumatic and very often fatal. \n\n There are two ways to remove a spike: manually or with powerful Allomantic Pulling or Pushing. Manual removal requires the character to be immobilized or incapacitated, and for another character to succeed with a Physique 5 roll. An Allomancer can also Steelpush or Ironpull a spike from a character’s body, but only with an Outcome of 5 or higher in a Contest of his metal vs. the character’s Physique. \n\n Each time a character loses a spike, he or she immediately loses 5 Health, and if this reduces the character’s Health to 0 or less he or she instantly dies from the trauma. A character who survives may recover naturally or through Breathers or magic — not only regaining this lost Health over time, but also the point of Charm, Wits, or Spirit forfeit when the spike was driven in. However, the characteristics and/or abilities the spike granted, as well as any Advancements spent to gain the spike, are lost for good (or at least until the same spike is driven back in). \n\n A removed spike may be transferred to another character at no Advancement cost, though that character still loses a point of Charm, Wits, Spirit, or a combination of those, as usual. \n\n Most Hemalurgic creations, like koloss and Steel Inquisitors, are slain if their spikes are removed — even when they have enough Health to survive process. Kandra who lose their last Blessing devolve back into mindless mistwraiths, returning to sentience and memory only if they receive their spikes again, or are fortunate enough to gain a new set."

        {
            "id":4,
            "name":"Twinborn",
            "basics":"Twinborn are rare and fortunate individuals who wield the rarest magical power of all: the ability to use both Allomancy and Feruchemy. The combination of these two Metallic Arts was unheard of prior to the Origin, but Harmony’s new world has allowed for the mingling of Allomantic and Feruchemical bloodlines, and in so doing created a whole new type of metalborn. While some Twinborn are the scions of noble families who married Terris shortly after the Origin, the descendants of Allomancers and Terris Keepers can come from all backgrounds and social strata. People whose parents lacked any Allomantic or Feruchemical abilities are almost as likely to become Twinborn as someone who is the child of an Allomancer and a Feruchemist. \n\n Each Twinborn is both a Misting and a Ferring, but only capable of using two metals. While this may seem weaker than the Mistborn and Keepers of the World of Ash, they are the only people who can use more than one type of metal in modern times. Additionally, the Twinborn’s ability to combine a Feruchemical and Allomantic power allows them to circumvent the limitations facing a normal Ferring or Allomancer. For instance, a Crasher Twinborn with the ability to use Allomantic Steel (Push on metal objects) and Feruchemical Iron (store and tap weight) can use her two abilities in unison to fly through the air more effectively than a Coinshot or push at objects far heavier than herself. Meanwhile, a Twinborn with the ability to use Feruchemical Gold and Allomantic Bendalloy can use his time-bubbles to give himself more time to store health, allowing him to heal more quickly and more often. \n\n In some rarer cases, a Twinborn is able to use the same Feruchemical and Allomantic metal, which allows him or her to perform Compounding. These Compounders can Allomantically burn their own metalminds, which exponentially amplifies the power of their stored charges and creates unusual but vastly powerful results. Compounded abilities are, in effect, an entirely new power which many Compounders commit their lives to mastering.",
            "society":"The majority of people who can’t use magic aren’t usually able to distinguish Twinborn from either Mistings or Ferrings, typically because Twinborn are so much rarer than the other types of metalborn. What most folk do know is that Twinborn are rare and sometimes dangerous individuals with impressive powers — either heroes torn from the pages of the latest pulp, or villains of sensationalist newspapers or campfire stories. Amongst other metalborn, Twinborn are regarded with a certain amount of suspicion (by those who do not trust their commitment or understanding of their powers) or envy (by those who covet a Twinborn’s potency). No matter what the individual attitudes are, nearly all folks can’t help but be impressed by what Twinborn can do when they truly exercise their power. \n\n Unlike Mistings and Ferrings, not many Twinborn seek specific employment based solely on the types of powers they possess — rather, those that hire them do so based on the Twinborn’s unique combinations of abilities. Twinborn with powers from both the Allomantic and Feruchemical physical metals may find themselves highly sought-after as lawkeepers, enforcers, or mercenaries; while those with more exotic combinations may find themselves the subject of academic or esoteric business ventures. Compounder Twinborn are the most pursued types of all, thanks to both their raw power and mythical reputation that ranks amongst the greatest heroes and legends of the Final Empire. Both riches and reputation can be easily won by those Twinborn willing to exploit their abilities to the fullest.",
            "types":"There are 256 different possible combinations of Twinborn in The Alloy of Law era, based on the metals that have been discovered and are available. The combinations of Allomantic and Feruchemical powers range from spectacularly powerful (as is the case with Crashers, who use Allomantic Steel and Feruchemical Iron to become engines of Metallic destruction) to middling, to outright indistinguishable from other Ferrings or Mistings (as is the case with any Twinborn using Allomantic Aluminum or Duralumin or Feruchemical Nicrosil). \n\n The table on page 180 lists nicknames and perceptions of notable types of Twinborn. These names change frequently with popular culture but should provide good grist for your own names and ideas!",
            "compounding":"Compounding is the most potent form of magic known in The Alloy of Law era. By combining Allomancy and Feruchemy in the same metal, a Compounder can burn charged metalminds, greatly enhancing their stored abilities and granting new abilities unavailable through other, more conventional powers. More importantly, Compounded metalminds release exponentially more power, which allows the Twinborn to overcome the central limitation of Feruchemy: that you can only tap as much of an ability as you have first stored. \n\n Compounders describe burning a metalmind as an incredible rush of power, like the feeling of burning any Allomantic metal, except far stronger. A few Compounders describe the feeling in terms most often used for strong intoxicants, euphoria, or a massive jolt of adrenaline.",

When you Compound, you Allomantically burn a charged metalmind (in game terms, the Feruchemical charges you’ve stored in that metalmind) to gain a massive jolt of Feruchemical power. This power can be spent to provide huge Feruchemical benefits or to activate abilities unachievable through Allomancy or Feruchemy alone (represented by Compounding Stunts, found on page 183). \n\n You may only Compound a metalmind that is in your body — thus, you must either ingest a metalmind, or pierce your body with it (such as an earring or non-Hemalurgic spike) in order to burn it and gain the benefits of Compounding. A metalmind in your body, whether swallowed or in a piercing, is still considered in physical contact, so you can still use Feruchemy to store and tap charges in it normally. Typically only small metalminds (capable of holding 25 charges) can be used for Compounding since they’re small enough to swallow or pierce an ear or nose without excessive damage.",

These charges can be spent like normal Feruchemical charges, used to activate Compounding Stunts, stored in another metalminds, or a combination of the three. Note that even though you can generate a huge amount of Feruchemical charges in this way, the maximum number of Feruchemical charges you can spend per action or roll is still limited to your Feruchemy rating × 10, as normal.",

Jann Compounds 1 charge, gaining 10 charges of caloric energy and leaving 19 charges still in her ingested bendalloymind.",

However, there are some limitations you’ll need to deal with — Compounding isn’t simple! \n\n To get the most out of your Compounding, you’ll want your Feruchemy rating and Allomancy Rating to keep pace with each other so that you can Compound enough charges and be able to spend those charges. Unless you plan to rely on your Allomancy for its normal Allomantic effects quite a bit, it’s usually best to increase your Feruchemy first, since you can still tap a bunch of charges normally without using Compounding if you need to. Also watch for other limits on your metal (like the previous example of Physique limiting how many charges of caloric energy Jann can store per hour). \n\n You’ll need to store in and ingest metalminds frequently, so look at taking more metalminds as Props so you have a steady supply. Juggling your inventory so you have metalminds ready to Compound when you need them is all part of being a Compounder. \n\n Though Compounding uses Allomancy to enhance Feruchemy, and the Feruchemical abilities are what Twinborn are known for, don’t forget you’re still a fully capable Allomancer! Take Misting vials or pouches as Props so you have a supply that isn’t reliant on just metalminds. \n\n Though you start off a bit behind on Stunts, you can do some amazing things once you’re able to buy a Compounding Stunt. It’s a great idea to look at the Compounding Stunt options for your metal early on and buy one you like once you have the Advancements to spend."

These unique effects are represented by Compounding Stunts, and are identified by the word “Compounding” in parentheses following their names. Any Compounder Twinborn Hero may gain Compounding Stunts corresponding to his metals during play using Advancements. \n\n Nearly all Compounding Stunts can only be used if the Compounder spends large amounts of Feruchemical charges. Unless noted otherwise, all Feruchemical charges spent to activate Compounding Stunts must be gained through Compounding; these are referred to in these Stunts as “Compounded charges.” \n\n For instance, if you Compound 4 charges from a pewtermind, you can use the resulting 40 charges to activate the Earthshaker Compounding Stunt, as normal Pewter Feruchemical charges, or a combination of the two. However, if you tap 40 charges from your pewtermind using Feruchemy, you can only use those charges as normal — you can’t use your Earthshaker Stunt."

You’ll make friends and enemies, enjoy epic triumphs and suffer vicious setbacks, and your choices and actions will only change the world but set the stage for many more adventures to come. In the end you’ll find that you’ve not only written your own legend but lived it, and the experience will stay with you long after the game is done.",
            "neverPlayed": "A tabletop roleplaying game (or RPG for short) is a bit different from other games. Instead of a screen and controller, or a board and pieces, you play with your imagination. You create and control a character, just like you would in a video game RPG, but here you can literally become anyone you can envision living in the Final Empire, and your options in play are only limited by what’s plausible in your character’s situation (and that will change from moment to moment). \n\n There are no preset locations to explore and your goals are whatever you want them to be. The world continues around you, even if you do nothing, and other characters act in rational ways because both the world and those other characters are controlled by actual people — your friends, who are also players in the game. \n\n Video games like to toss around the term “sandbox” to identify RPGs that let you wander in an open world, exploring areas, interacting with other characters, and tackling quests as you see fit. This is also true of the Mistborn Adventure Game, but without the limitations of what’s programmed to happen. You can go anywhere and try anything. You even set your own goals, though as we say, the world and other characters are controlled by actual people, and they may have other ideas. \n\n Playing an RPG is a lot like improvisational theatre: you have an idea who your character is, what he or she can do, and the situation you’re facing, but it’s how you act that matters. As in theater there’s no “winning” or “losing” — everyone wins just for playing and having a good time with friends. Of course your character has goals, and there’s joy in realizing those, but the real excitement is had in stretching your creative muscles — in walking in someone else’s shoes, and creating something new and memorable along the way. \n\n You might wonder whether that’s the only challenge in the game — whether the only hurdle is mastering the art of communal storytelling. It’s not. Your Hero’s actions are often bold (some might say “daring,” others “stupid”). There’s always risk in truly courageous efforts, and the Mistborn Adventure Game uses dice to determine the outcome of your riskiest actions. Part of the challenge (and the fun!) lies in learning what comes next, and thinking on your feet quickly and bravely enough to survive, and thrive, against even the most dangerous odds. \n\n You have an opportunity here to do something important in Scadrial, to take up a mantle few have considered for a thousand years, and truly own the title of “Hero” in a world of Villains. Strike out on your own in a game without limits, and finally answer that age-old question: “How would I have done it differently?” There’s only one way to find out. Keep reading, and dream...",
            "experienced": "For those of you who’ve played RPGs before, the Mistborn Adventure Game is a relatively rules-light, strongly narrative storytelling game. There are no levels, no “grinding” for XP, and no killing things and taking their stuff. The mechanics are straightforward enough that you can easily create the character you want and get going with minimum fuss, transparent enough that they fade into the background whenever they aren’t needed, and just robust enough to model a wide variety of fairly complex situations. \n\n Features include social and mental conflicts, story-driven bonuses, and a trouble-free dice system ensuring the rules support, rather than impede, your fun. Fans of indie games like FATE, Savage Worlds, and Storyteller should feel right at home with the Mistborn Adventure Game, and may recognize many core assumptions throughout. \n\n Of course, the Mistborn novels are known for their incredibly potent and diverse magic systems, and the Adventure Game places those front and center without sacrificing balance. Great effort has been taken to ensure characters from any background can all contribute strongly, whether they have magic or not, and even if they’re born slaves, or worse. This is accomplished through a quick choice of priorities during character creation, whereby characters without magic or with less magic than others, are given other setting-appropriate perks and abilities (personal strengths and standing in society).",
            "needPlay": "Friends: At least one and ideally three to five. One of you becomes the Narrator, who like the author of a novel sets the stage and directs the many Villains and Extras who populate the world. Unlike a novel author however, the Narrator doesn’t control the protagonists of this saga — that’s the job of the other players, who are called Heroes. (These other players are always called “Heroes,” even when their goals and actions venture into wicked territory, for even the truest villains think themselves the heroes of their own stories.) Together, your Heroes form a Crew, which works together to accomplish goals, face challenges set forth by the Narrator, and explore the dangers and mysteries of the Final Empire. \n\n Dice: The Mistborn Adventure Game uses six-sided dice (the cube-shaped ones you find in most family board games), and you should have at least five to ten of them. The Narrator and most players will probably want their own sets but it isn’t required. These dice are used to determine many things, including whether Heroes, Villains, and Extras succeed or fail at difficult tasks, and sometimes how well they do when they succeed, or what complications arise when they fail. \n\n Paper: The Narrator will want to keep notes and track the conditions and abilities of his Villains and Extras, and the Heroes will want to do the same. We provide sheets for these purposes starting on page 556 and you can photocopy these if you like. \n\n Imagination: A roleplaying game is a storytelling exercise and every player — the Narrator and every Hero — contributes to the outcome and fun of the story. This is part of what makes a roleplaying game different from other games: your input makes it a unique experience every time you play, and your collaboration contributes to a world and story that’s very much your own. The more imagination each of you brings to the game, the more creativity each of you contributes, the greater your story becomes and the more memorable it is for everyone.",
            "narrator":"Start by reading “What Makes a Character”, which explains the building blocks common to Heroes, Villains, and Extras. You can skip the rest of Building Heroes until you’re familiar with how the game plays. The basic rules of play are essential, as is “Playing the Narrator” in Book 3, which talks about running the game. You can also read through “Creating Your Own Characters”, or you can keep it simple and use the samples provided on starting on the left. \n\n As everyone will be learning for the first few sessions, we recommend you keep your first adventure small — no more than three sessions — and let everyone adjust their characters right after it ends. You’ll want to read through all of Books 1 and 2 before then, so you can tweak your plans and characters as well.",
            "everyoneElse": "After your first read-through of Building Heroes, you should be able to create a character in under 10 minutes (a little more if you spend lots of time considering the options and adding flavor to your Hero). If this is your first time playing an RPG and you want to see how it all works before creating your own Hero, or you don’t really know what kind of character you want right now, several samples are included. \n\n Game Basics start on page 131, and it’s helpful to know as much about them as possible, though players other than the Narrator only really need to understand how to form pools, roll dice, and use Nudges. The rest you can learn as you play."

You’re keeping track though and each indignity will cost them, big. You’re a mastermind and your crew — the well-regarded Nine Eyes — operates smoothly thanks to you always planning five steps ahead. \n\n Your parents were loyal, obedient sorts who raised you well. They taught you to anticipate the needs of your betters, and those lessons gave you an edge over most skaa in the eyes of the nobility. Nevertheless, when a terrible sickness swept through the city in your youth, your parents and brother were left to die. Everything changed, and you became your own man, family first and curse the Lord Ruler. \n\n Now you have a thriving public business, a wife, two strong boys, and everything is going great. Your family doesn’t know about your criminal activities but you sometimes catch your beloved looking at you with just a hint of suspicion, and you worry about what she’ll do if she finds out the truth. \n\n Among your crewmates, Thorrow is a worry. You’ve got a gut feeling that it’s only a matter of time before he loses it, and you’ve taken precautions to distance yourself and the crew if that should happen. Still, you can’t help caring and you hope that it doesn’t come to that. \n\n Sev’s drinking is getting out of hand, but confronting him means getting past his sister, which is difficult to consider once she starts fluttering those perfect lashes. Wait, you’re married, aren’t you? \n\n Damosi and Gavon remind you so much of your sons. Damosi always follows his own agenda like your oldest, and Gavon, like your youngest, he’s got no agenda at all. The combination could be trouble, but really, how could you turn them away? \n\n JeHoy... Normally you’d be a lot less keen to keep one of “those things” around, but this one’s proved more level-headed and conscious of the crew’s needs than many so-called “professionals” you’ve had at your side.

Fortunately it’s a job you can do almost anywhere, as you learn as much from the assumptions of those outside the city as from those who live there. \n\n Working with a crew lets you move between social classes and quarters, and with every job you store more knowledge in your metalminds. So long as that continues, you’re happy to keep with the Nine Eyes and see where the future leads. \n\n A strange thing happened in your youth — you slipped through the cracks. The Obligators didn’t realize you were a Feruchemist, but neither did the Terris people. Only years later, when you traveled to Luthadel as a young steward, did an older Keeper named Gahela discover and nurture your abilities. She risked everything to get you a meeting with the Synod, and you still regret that she didn’t survive the journey. It’s Gahela’s path you now walk, for she was Luthadel’s chronicler before you. The Synod charged you with her duties and so you honor them, and her sacrifice, with every detail gleaned. \n\n Lately, your research has led you in an unexpected direction. You’ve found yourself listening in on private conversations between members of the crew and people with especially rare knowledge of the capital. You don’t plan to use anything you learn against the crew of course, but you know this could be seen as a betrayal, and so you stay quiet and hope you never have to choose between your mission and your friends. \n\n Beck is a good leader, and a sensible man.

You constantly press your luck, often overstepping the bounds of your assumed position, and you’ve even tipped off a few of your employers (though so far you and the crew have made sure your secret went no further). \n\n The real danger, of course, is other stewards.

It’s part of the life. \n\n You actually were a steward for a little while. The training seemed exciting at the time, so close to the nobility, but you now know how demeaning it really is. The Lord Ruler takes so much from the Terris people; does he need your dignity as well? \n\n Your first assignment as a steward sent you to a small country outpost belonging to House Hasting. It was a dreadful experience. Not only was the lord unbearably cruel to his skaa but he forced you to join in their humiliation. You slipped away as soon as you could. \n\n Your next assignment took you to Luthadel, where you were approached and recruited by the Nine Eyes.

When he couldn’t afford to pay his debts to a Soother named Sev (who was posing as a noble at the time), he offered your services for two years instead. Those two years cannot pass quickly enough. \n\n You bristle working for these thieves but do as the Contract dictates. Sev’s orders are often maddeningly vague or risky, and they frequently conflict with your own sensible, conservative opinions. You always have to keep those all-important words of kandra wisdom in mind: “You must compel me under the Contract to my true employer, his rights temporarily transferred to you by proxy.” \n\n At least the crew finds you useful. You’re often tasked as an infiltrator and your Blessing of Awareness makes up for the fact that they have no Tineye.

You much prefer it there, with your elegant hardwood True Body and its intricate carvings. Human flesh still feels a bit strange, and you sometimes itch or adjust yourself involuntarily — a quirk that’s nearly gotten you into trouble more than once. \n\n Your inexperience might even have caused you to kill. Before you started with the Nine Eyes, Damien had you infiltrate a group of skaa merchants. They saw through your disguise and you left one of them bleeding on the ground as you escaped. The First Contract forbids your kind from killing — even skaa — and to this day you’re not sure whether that man lived or died.

You eventually found her sick and impoverished, robbed and left for dead a year before by a gang of 4 bandits. You helped her as best you could, nursing her through the last few months of her life. Then you set out after the bandits; you learned to use your bronzeminds to put off sleep and keep yourself alert for a fight, and you figured out how your Allomancy could keep situations peaceful and persuade people to talk to you. \n\n At the end of six months, you’d killed one bandit and captured the other three. Along the way you learned to like the money, but you liked the feeling of making the Roughs a safer place even more. You tell yourself that you don’t care about your family, but you also know that you want to become famous enough as a bounty hunter that you can ride back into Elendel someday with a fine horse and a finer reputation. Maybe then your grandfather and cousins will look upon you as an equal. \n\n In the meantime, you’ve become the unwitting leader of a whole passel of miscreants and wanderers. You have to keep a close watch over Sperry, but Enid knows what she’s doing and is a real professional. You’ve got respect for Anders’ convictions; if you could be a man of faith and stand up for a principle, you would. But that’s not the world you live in. ",

She was gentle and compassionate in ways you’d never considered possible. She told you to reject your spikes and instead go to school, to learn and lead your people on a path toward progress. She gave you an earring and a wad of notes, and then vanished. So you went. \n\n Harmony seemed to have paved your way through university. It was, perhaps, more enlightening than it was educational. Your degree is some words on a piece of paper, but your understanding of the way humans do things was enough to help you reject both lifestyles in parts. You realized even if the koloss way of life won’t last forever, human society has its own shortcomings. You know your people need another path — one of education, land, respect. Even in the Roughs, those things cost money. \n\n It’s difficult to explain to humans what it means to refuse the spikes. Yours is the blood of chiefs, but you’ll never be able to make children with other koloss. You’ll never have a mate, never be a sire. That pain eats at you. You may shepherd other koloss-blooded some day, guide them into the world of humanity, but you worry it won’t be the same. \n\n You have an uneasy respect for what Anders does, though you don’t put much stock in his manner of religion. “Bandy” Jann irritates you, sometimes badly, so you try to use her to practice self-control.

No one is too high or too low for your tastes. \n\n Your pappy was the greatest grifter anywhere out in the Roughs and half the city besides. He built confidence and knocked it down as easy as some folks breathe. But what he couldn’t do is steal confidence. That’s where you blew him out of the water. It’s a ruined shame the way he had to take the fall, but at least he’s just in prison forever, ’stead of hanged. \n\n Of course, that wasn’t what really got you into the Crew. It was Grinnel who melted it down and forged it — you were too good at what you do, and were like as not to end up like your pappy should you stay anywhere too long. He said that what you needed were limits, to do a little good with your Connector skills to keep your neck out of the noose. You were skeptical at first, but so far, it’s worked out. A little push and pull here and there, and the Crew at least tolerates your…activities. Plus Grinnel covers for you and keeps you as honest as he can. It ain’t a bad deal. \n\n Most men got secrets; way you figure it, your worst and deepest secret is the truth — about you, about your life, everything. You’ve been at this for so long you don’t even know when you’re lying anymore. You’d like to have an honest relationship, maybe find a fella who could really see you for who you are with no malarkey involved, but you ain’t holding your breath. \n\n The Crew trusts you because they sort of have to, and there are some days you’re not even sure if you’re running a con on them or not. Aside from Grinnel keeping you true as titanium, you’ve made quite the ally in Janella. When money is running low, sometimes you and she slip off, do a little side job to raise some capital, and hope for the best.

They must also overcome great hardships on the road to glory or infamy, rising above devastating poverty, institutionalized oppression, ethnic cleansing, and sometimes even the shackles of slavery. This struggle to realize one’s calling without falling prey to the demons of the past is the mark of a true hero. \n\n Many characters in your story have a Destiny (a higher purpose, which may or may not have been fated), and a Tragedy (a traumatic event or memory that haunts the character to this day). All Heroes have both, and many Villains do as well. \n\n A Hero’s Destiny or Tragedy may be unknown to the Hero (or even the player) when the game starts, becoming something to discover. A player or Hero may also believe his or her Destiny is one thing when it’s really another. Meanwhile, the Narrator knows all characters’ Destinies and Tragedies, including the Villains’, though he or she may decide a Villain is unaware and roleplay accordingly. \n\n Destiny and Tragedy unfold like subplots, in that they have Beginnings, Middles, and Ends, and their game effects are progressively more potent the deeper you get into their story. The Narrator may sometimes have you script your own Destinies and Tragedies, especially if he or she wants you to embrace and apply them as you describe your character’s actions. Most of the time, though, you’ll identify your character’s Destiny and Tragedy and the Narrator will develop the scripts so that part of your character’s story is gradually revealed over the course of the game. \n\n It’s possible your character may fulfill his or her Destiny, or conquer his or her Tragedy in play — this is often the meat of truly mighty storytelling, after all — and such a momentous event warrants care, attention, and celebration within the Crew. The Narrator might even decide it merits new Advancements (see page 113) or even a Turning Point (see page 428).",
            "brandon2": "One thing to keep in mind is that a great character often has a great limitation, or in game terms, a great Tragedy. Don’t look at it as a weakness you’re annoyed to have. Look at it as one of the most defining aspects of who your character is. All great heroes from fiction — from Spiderman to Frodo to Jean Valjean — have defining moments like this in their past, and you should too. Often, it is what a character cannot do that makes them truly come alive.",

They’re also a currency more valuable than atium; Vin’s discovery of Duralumin grants her a tremendous edge over other Mistborn, and TenSoon’s revelation about the kandra not only signs his death warrant but also helps him change the course of history. \n\n In the Mistborn Adventure Game, Secrets can impact the story (the location of a hidden base, for example, or the identity of a long-sought assassin), or they can impact the rules (access to a hidden cache of atium grants great Allomantic power, as does learning to control koloss or kandra with Allomancy). Some very precious Secrets do both these things. \n\n Revealing a Secret at the right time can also offer significant advantages with certain tasks or against the right opponents. For example, a Hero hunting a masked thief might spread the thief’s true identity across a city, making it far easier to capture him. Alternatively, the Hero might only reveal the Secret to someone the thief loves, knowing it would drive a wedge between them. \n\n You may discover Secrets through play, or as you complete Schemes and achieve other goals. Much more information about Secrets can be found in Book 3 (see pages 427 and 455)."

They have a few thoughts about the types of Heroes they want to play, but Brandon has advised them to nail down why they work together before getting too deep into their individual stories. \n\n Peter describes his concept: a skaa fixer working for nobles who secretly hates them. Knowing that character creation is all about questions, Brandon asks why. Peter thinks on it a moment and decides that his Hero’s family died when a disease swept through their home city, and that his Hero couldn’t save them because the nobility cordoned off infected parts of the city rather than tend to the sick. \n\n Ben wants to play a street thief Misting, and he likes this noble angle. He suggests that maybe his Hero has a dark secret: that he murdered a young noble who was getting a little too frisky with his sister, and buried the body outside their home city. (Anticipating Brandon’s next question, he quickly looks at the world map and adds that his Hero’s home city is Fadrex.) \n\n Emily wants to play a kandra, so among other things she has to consider whether her Hero has a Contract, and if so, who it’s with and what that means for the Crew. Until this discussion, she’d assumed her Hero was Contracted to a noble, but she likes the direction this is going and wonders aloud if maybe Peter’s Hero might hold her Contract instead. Always a little mischievous, Ben interjects that maybe his street thief won her Contract in a game of shelldry and after a good laugh, the group agrees. \n\n “It’s for the best,” Emily says, already settling into character. “I never liked my former master anyway.” \n\n Always with the questions, Brandon asks why. (“Why?” is the most powerful question of all during Hero creation, and indeed at any point in the game when you need more detail.) \n\n Emily decides it’s because her former master was abusive and kept sending her on dangerous jobs that he didn’t want to be linked to. “That’s another noble we don’t like,” Peter adds, and the Crew’s cause and target start to come together. \n\n “You all have problems with nobles,” Brandon observes, and everyone looks to the last player. \n\n Isaac is thinking of playing a Terrisman Keeper, and while he doesn’t have an immediate idea for why his Hero might dislike nobles, he proposes that perhaps a Keeper might join the Crew because of what he might learn from their jobs. Brandon already knows that most of the story will take place in Luthadel, so he submits that maybe the Synod sent Isaac’s Hero to learn more about the city — and what better way than working against its nobility? \n\n All that’s left is determining the Crew’s preferred method. Isaac would like the Crew to remain fairly low-profile so his personal mission isn’t obscured by a lot of fighting, and the others like the idea of their jobs hitting the nobility where it hurts. Peter hits the nail on the head, saying, “We take back what’s ours. We’re thieves.” \n\n The Crew’s cause, target, and method are in place: they seek revenge (cause) on the nobility (target) through theft (method). Everyone jots these details down on their sheets, and the discussion moves on to fleshing out the individual Heroes.",

He thinks the thief might be 'guarded', but Ben is concerned that this might be a little too strong, so he goes with 'cautious'. \n\n Ben wonders how Emily’s Hero is coping with what’s turning out to be a lot of stress (not uncommon for a kandra). He suggests 'reserved' and she agrees. Emily suggests 'quiet' for Isaac’s Keeper, but he’s not so sure about this.

His Hero clearly values loved ones, but also monetary worth, and his early choice for his Hero’s first family to perish through noble fear and indifference still rings very true as the emotional core of his concept. He combines all these things, writing “My parents and brother worked like dogs but died as paupers” in the Tragedy section of his character sheet. Brandon makes a note and looks to Ben. \n\n Ben follows a similar train of thought to determine his Hero’s Tragedy, focusing on the event that turned him away from nobles: the murder of the noble who accosted his sister.

She’s inspired by all this death surrounding the Crew — and how much Brandon seems to enjoy scribbling down all those notes on his Secrets sheet — so she runs with his suggestion, writing “I unwittingly violated the First Contract.” Brandon looks over and asks if she’s sure about that. “There’s no going back,” he says. She considers and adds “— or did I?” at the end. Brandon nods approvingly and makes another note. \n\n Isaac wants to give the Narrator another bloody story seed, and he figures the whole Crew’s already knee-deep in corpses anyway, so he pulls Brandon aside for a private discussion. He pitches that his Keeper had a wise mentor, and that it’s her work he carries on now. They set out from the Terris mountains together but she never made it to Luthadel, and so his Tragedy is that “My mentor died before I could learn everything from her.” \n\n Brandon really likes the underlying idea but doesn’t think it’s quite a Tragedy yet — for that Isaac’s Hero needs to feel a little more responsible for the mentor’s death. Isaac agrees but all the ideas he comes up with immediately are too convoluted or don’t feel right. “Don’t worry,” Brandon says. “We can fill in the details when we have a better grasp of your Hero. Give your mentor a name, though. We’ll need that much before we start.” Isaac’s fine with this, so he writes “Gahela died because of my weakness” on his character sheet.

As outsiders, mercenaries, criminals, outlaws, and rebels, members may find themselves always on the run, dead at the hands of an enemy, slowly withering away in prison, or tormented under an interrogator’s knife. No one in their right mind would take such chances unless they believed the rewards outweighed the risk — not even a Hero. \n\n Beyond your character’s motives for joining the crew, imagine what he or she believes they’re meant to do. In a perfect world, with all the right tools at hand, what does your character think or hope to accomplish? This is a personal question, and should be answered separately for each character, above and beyond the goals and dreams of the crew. \n\n Your answer should differ from your Drive Trait (see Question 1, page 82), though it can certainly be related. If your character is a noble who joined the crew hoping to rebuild his name, he might believe his ultimate purpose is to lead his house to victory over a rival. Likewise, a thief may have thrown in with the other heroes to become famous, all the while dreaming of finding a secret so powerful it will shake the Empire to its foundations. \n\n This is your chance to think big. Your answer to this final question should be something your character can’t possibly achieve on his or her own, something grand in scope that’s daring and dangerous enough to be truly worthy of a Hero.

Beyond the questions they typically answer, they should ask what led to each of the improvements they’ve made to their characters, and ideally tie their answers together as a group narrative of what’s come before.

Kelsier’s plot to overthrow the Lord Ruler is a classic example of this, with sparking a rebellion to draw off the Luthadel garrison, instigating a war between houses Tekiel and Elariel, planting Marsh within the Steel Ministry, slipping Vin into noble society, and getting away with the Lord Ruler’s treasures each being a distinct goal that might reward Advancements en route to the ultimate prize."

She Snaps as a Pewter Misting, though it does her no good until the condition wears off, many hours later. \n\n Fortunately for Shayna, her only ally in the family recognizes her death for what it really is — not just a debilitating condition but also a sign of latent Allomantic talents, just as exhibited in several of their ancestors (the rest of the family is far too greedy and self-occupied to read, let alone read about people who’ve been dead for hundreds of years).

A Crew of this sort may be working for themselves, a wealthy patron, a university, or a township, seeking anything from a rumored cache of atium to headline-grabbing exploits in the Elendel Daily. Since the most fertile lands for adventure are deep in the dangerous Roughs, there’s every reason for a scholar, diplomat, or lawkeeper to be working alongside a gunslinger, thief, or koloss-blooded warrior. \n\n What holds these Crews together is not so much a particular way of doing things (in game terms, the Crew’s Method), as it is their objective (both their Cause and Target). Your group should think carefully about these choices when deciding on your Crew, and the Heroes’ roles within it. \n\n Stories around adventuring Crews can be very diverse affairs, encouraging them to travel far and wide and meet all sorts of interesting characters and situations.

Some may fight for the money, some may fight for glory, but for people of the frontier, these brave individuals are the thin line between order and chaos, justice and submission, right and wrong. \n\n Lawkeeper Crews are a solid “default” mode for a game set in The Alloy of Law era, thanks to an accessible premise which casts the Heroes as the good guys with a clear purpose. Out in the Roughs, nearly any man or woman willing to stand up for what’s right can be a lawkeeper, or be deputized by one, so putting a Crew together as a lawkeeper posse is an easy way to bring many diverse character concepts together under a single banner. \n\n The defining features of a lawkeeper Crew are its Target and Methods — a group that chooses to combat “Corruption” “By the Letter of the Law” will work much differently than one that chases “Bounties” using “Extreme Force.” All players should discuss what sort of lawkeepers they want to be and what’s in it for them, before settling on these essential questions of what they’re after and how they’re pursuing it. \n\n Lawkeeper stories are pretty easy for a Narrator to set up as well — just create a villain and a scenario that puts the Crew on a collision course with him, and let them take it from there. While it may be tempting to make these stories simple “find bad guy/shoot bad guy/ride off into sunset” affairs, there are many more variations on the story.

They could be bounty hunters, guns for hire, security contractors, consulting detectives, or cat’s paws in a war between two competing mining companies…bound together only by the almighty dollar. \n\n Mercenary Crews are a classic trope of the Western genre, putting the Heroes in pursuit of treasure or personal gain. Typically, these teams are made up of rough-and-tumble characters who are hired for their skill at fighting and keeping their mouths shut. Their patrons tend to be powerful groups like noble Houses or companies, but can also be smaller organizations like a town, parish, or even a family. \n\n Crews of mercenaries do not tend to have strong Causes or Targets (though “Wealth” is popular), but their Methods are central to their identity; whether the Heroes are private investigators or hired guns, their Methods are likely the reason they were hired in the first place! Expanding personal wealth should be considered a result of the Crew’s work rather than the goal itself: since the Mistborn Adventure Game doesn’t allow Heroes to hold on to looted items for very long by design, players hoping to amass giant stockpiles of notes and bars might quickly find themselves disappointed. \n\n Mercenary stories pose an interesting question. On the one hand, executing missions on behalf of a wealthy patron is easy for the tabletop RPG format; on the other, they’re kind of boring! The best stories for mercenary Heroes add an additional layer to “just following orders.” For example, a traditional twist to these tales pits the Crew’s selfish motives (personal gain) against other, loftier ideals (justice, honor, fairness) by making them face the victims or ugly realities of their employers’ goals, leaving the Heroes to ask: what is the price of our desires, and who should pay it? What do we lose of ourselves in the process? Both the players and the Narrator should always be looking for new ways to explore these questions and add emotional depth to the Crew’s exploits."

What defines all these stories is that the only path to addressing these injustices is to go outside the laws and the system that creates them. \n\n Vigilante Heroes can come from any walk of life, though most often they’re drawn from those without power or easy access to justice through the system — farmers, laborers, small-town folk, or members of a minority group being the most common seekers of satisfaction by extralegal means. Crews of these wronged folk often are formed through a mutual slight, perhaps being coworkers at the same mine, members of the same community, or survivors of the same massacred tribe. \n\n Vigilante Crews are united not by their skills or their backgrounds, but by their mutual desire for revenge against those that wronged them. Consequently, Cause is the Crew’s most important aspect (“Revenge”) followed very closely by Target (the source of the injustice). Method is a distant third, as vigilantes by definition are willing to do whatever it takes to get satisfaction. \n\n Revenge-centered stories tend to be very focused on the investigation and execution of the Crew’s plot, step by bloody step, for it’s the desire for vengeance that holds the group together.

The organization of these Crews is much like that of Kelsier’s team: a set of specialists who each play a role in their heists. \n\n For criminal Crews, Targets and Methods tend to be the most important defining choices (Target defining whom they prey upon, and Method describing how they choose to do it). Cause is not very important…it’s pretty clear that modern Scadrian criminals are more opportunistic than those of the past. \n\n Criminal stories tend to fall into one of two categories: those focusing on pulling off a series of increasingly daring heists; or those centered on the group’s illicit activities, and coping with the fallout from them (gang war, going on the run, etc.).

A missionary Crew can be composed of nearly any sort of character; aside from the obligatory preacher or true believer who acts as the head of the Crew, there could be religious scholars, bodyguards, scouts, or even reformed criminals seeking a chance at redemption. \n\n A missionary Crew is all about the Cause — bringing the light of their faith to others. Their Methods may vary wildly, as some seek peaceful conversion and others go with fire and brimstone. The Crew’s Target is likely very large, probably focusing on unbelievers, but it could also be aimed at another faith the Crew wishes to undo as part of a spiritual crusade. \n\n Missionary Crews are an unusual way to tell stories in The Alloy of Law era, mainly because there is little precedent in entertainment or in the original trilogy to refer to.

From previous discussions with the players individually, he knows the players are interested in getting the bad guys the law can’t touch, and has tentatively set the Crew’s Cause as “Bounty Hunting” and their Target as “Outlaws.” Next he asks what their Method is. \n\n Filamena and David both want to play characters who are good at fighting, while John wants to play the Crew Leader, and Jess has been thinking about a more investigative or social character. \n\n Brandon reminds the players they’ll need to think carefully about how these concepts all fit together in a comprehensive story. What would a social character do with a bunch of tough guys, chasing criminals? After a lively discussion, the group decides that the non-fighting characters would be the brains of the outfit, providing guile and subtlety when chasing tough bounties.

Brandon asks why his character became a bounty hunter. John thinks for a bit and decides that his mother fled from Elendel to the Roughs after she was caught stealing from her own family. When his Hero came of age, he went out into the Roughs to look for her. He eventually found his mother dying, her money stolen; he went on to track down her killers and found that he had a taste for bounty hunting. \n\n Jess then says that she wants to play a con artist and grifter. Brandon asks why her criminally-inclined character would join a Crew of people who mostly seem to be about catching outlaws. Jess considers and says that maybe John’s bounty hunter found the con artist before he got too far on the wrong side of the law, and offered him another use for his talents.

For example, if your Hero gains the ability to use one of the four Spiritual metals (Chromium, Nicrosil, Aluminum, & Duralumin), he or she may be contacted by the local leaders of the Terris community, who are both very interested in these abilities, and also invested in keeping knowledge of these abilities from becoming too widespread."

These circumstances depend on the power the Hero wishes to develop: typically, a character who is already an Allomancer must spend time developing the same discipline and reflection that someone without Powers must perform to become a Ferring, while a character who is already a Ferring must suffer a moment of great turmoil or trauma to Snap an Allomantic ability.

The most common source of explosions is dynamite, which is used for mining and as an improvised weapon, but other events such as bombs, gunpowder accidents, and exploding train boilers all present danger to those nearby. \n\n Explosions are unlike other attacks in two ways. First, the amount of damage dealt by an explosion is set, based on how close a character is to the center of the explosion (or the target of the explosive attack). Explosive damage is expressed as 2 values: an explosion’s primary damage is the amount of damage characters closer to the center suffer, while its secondary damage is the amount suffered by characters further away. Each number is followed by a note indicating at what Range from the target the primary and secondary damage are inflicted. \n\n Characters caught in the area of an explosion may attempt to escape damage by making a Physique roll, reducing the damage suffered by the Result, to a minimum of 0 (e.g., a Result of 3 on the Physique roll reduces the damage suffered by 3). During a Conflict, this roll is considered a Reaction and used in place of the normal Defense roll (you may add Action or Defense Dice to this pool if you’d like, though you may not roll more than 10 dice, as usual). The following are several common types of explosions:",

                "part1":"Playing the Mistborn Adventure Game is a little like having a conversation with your friends, except that each of you is playing a role (the one you may have just created with the tools in the Building Heroes section). One of you, the Narrator, sets the scene by briefly describing your surroundings, and he or she also controls all the characters the rest of you aren’t playing (which may sound like a lot of work, but most of them aren’t as detailed as the Heroes). \n\n Some of the conversation involves speaking “in character,” which means that, for as long as you’re comfortable, everything you say also comes out of your character’s mouth in the game world. Some players like to adopt accents and mannerisms to portray their character as well, though it’s not required. The Narrator may use this trick to help the other players identify which character he or she is portraying at any given moment, and this can really help the game flow more fluidly. \n\n The rest of the conversation involves description, usually of what your character is doing. In a narrative game like this, which doesn’t use a play board or pieces to signify where the characters are, description keeps everyone’s mental picture of the game world the same, or at least as close as two readers of the same novel. \n\n Here’s a brief example of how a common Mistborn Adventure Game session might open...",

Maybe we can refer to each other as ‘Eyes’?”  \n - Emily (stifling a laugh): “The Four Eyes? That won’t work.”  \n - Peter: “The Nine Eyes. That way we have some room to add folks.” \n - Brandon: “Justin might join next week. He has some ideas for a Terris steward named Gavon.” \n - Emily: “The Nine Eyes Crew it is then! What’s our first job?” \n - Brandon (checking his notes): “You’ve been contacted through discreet channels by a pair of Mistborn—” \n - Peter (eyes narrowing): “Nobles?” \n - Brandon: “Yes, but you have it on good authority they’re too busy living the high life to pay much attention to anyone else.” \n - Ben: “So they’re spoiled little rich kids. Awesome.” \n - Brandon: “They’re also offering a king’s ransom for what looks like a pretty simple job.” \n - Ben: “Liars too?” \n - Brandon: “You might be able to mount that rebellion you’re planning in the Farmost Dominance...” \n - Peter: “Well then, our doors and ears are open. Aren’t they Sev?” \n - Ben shoots Peter a thoughtful glance and everyone realizes Peter’s just slipped into character. \n - Ben (in the gruff voice he’s adopting for Sev): “I still don’t trust them.” \n - Brandon (adjusting his voice as well): “Who? Us? We’re just two legitimate employers with a lot of money and a reasonable offer...” \n - Brandon (miming the newcomer’s fist around a sack of boxings and resuming his natural voice): “You hear the tell-tale rattle of coins.

You’re rich.” \n - Brandon (back to the first Mistborn’s voice): “Simply well to do. Ignore my brother.

Sometimes called the ‘Bylerum Boys.’ They have a bit of a reputation: small house, big dreams.” \n - Isaac (his curiosity piqued): “Dreams?” \n - Brandon: “Rumor has it they’re less interested in tending to their family’s affairs than flirting with greater nobility.” \n - Ben (in character): “What brings you down to our level? We don’t exactly live the high life here.” \n - Brandon (Carrow): “We’re in the market for... procurement. We understand that’s what you do.” \n - Peter (Beck): “On occasion. What do you need procured?” \n - Brandon (Carrow): “A family heirloom.” \n - Emily (JeHoy): “Who has it?” \n - Brandon (Cordal): “Stole it. Right off our property.” \n - Ben (Sev, snorting): “Sounds like you need better guards.” \n - Brandon: “Cordal bristles but Carrow cuts him off.” (as Carrow) “We know you’re not fans of the nobility, and we can’t fault your reasons. Your wife didn’t need to die, Beck, and you, JeHoy—“ \n - Emily (out of character): “Hold on. They know our secrets? How?” \n - Brandon: “They’re wealthy, and well-connected.” \n - Peter (speaking for Beck): “So am I, and I assume I’ve spent a good deal of personal capital to bury my secrets. And theirs, as well.” He indicates the other players, the Crew. \n - Brandon (knowing he could confirm this detail but also knowing it would rub the other players the wrong way, and justifiably so): “That’s fair.” He takes a moment and picks up the narrative where it left off, once again speaking in Carrow’s voice: “We know you’re not fans of the nobility. You only take jobs that hurt them, and you’ve scored several impressive wins lately. You’ve made many powerful enemies.” \n - The players are pleased with this new development, and Brandon’s happy he didn’t have to adjust the plot he has planned for the evening. \n - Brandon (Cordal): “We can help with that — if you help us.” \n - Peter (Beck): “Where’s the heirloom?” \n - Brandon (Cordal): “Keep Hasting.” \n - Ben (remembering the novels, and knowing Sev would have the same knowledge): “What? Are you mad? That’s one of the most heavily guarded houses in the city.” \n - Brandon (Cordal): “Still think we need better guards?” \n - Isaac (Damosi): “Beck’s right. Hasting’s no pushover. We might not be the Crew for you.” \n - Emily (receiving a text): “Justin’s almost here. He thinks it would be interesting for Gavon to be Damosi’s brother.” \n - Brandon (seizing an opportunity and speaking in Carrow’s voice): “We also know you have a man on the inside.” He looks to Isaac (Damosi) and adds, “You’re the Crew for us.” \n - Isaac isn’t sure he wants his Hero to have a brother but he also knows the Terris blood-bond isn’t often all that strong. He also knows that Brandon can confirm this regardless, and considering how quickly he dove on the idea, he thinks that may just happen. \n - Isaac nods. “I’ll contact Gavon, then.” \n - Peter (Beck): “Carrow, Cordal... It looks like we have ourselves a deal.”",
                "part4":"Here the Narrator uses a player’s idea to keep the story on track and to strengthen relationships in the Crew. He also acquiesces when it’s clear that his initial description violates a story point some of the players feel strongly about. Knowing when and what to veto and confirm is a difficult skill to master but it’s also key to promoting a positive play experience. \n\n In the healthiest and most fulfilling RPG experiences, everyone is careful not to take the characters or the story anywhere that will make the others uncomfortable, or worse, offend them. The strongest players talk about the game a bit beforehand, to get a sense of what everyone is hoping for, and what they find fun and exciting, so they can tailor their descriptions accordingly.",
                "brandon":"When adding description, you want to keep the story moving and not always keep the focus on you, the Narrator or player. Rather, you want it on the characters. However, you also want to set the scene appropriately. Some GMs (Narrators) I’ve played with like to spend long, ponderous minutes describing every detail of a scene — to the point that, instead of imagining in great detail, the players get bored. This happens in books, too. \n\n The best descriptions are short, dense, and sensory. Don’t go over every detail of a nobleman’s fine carriage; contrast the gold on its doors with the scent of horse dung on the street. Your audience (the other players, including the Narrator unless you’re running the game) should feel the scene as you talk about yelling shopkeepers and ash floating from the sky, but be careful not to drone on and on. \n\n Often, focusing on one small detail — such as how an abandoned doll in the corner of a room has become a nest for rats — can paint a scene far more vividly than fifteen minutes talking about how dusty, old, and ragged the place is."

            "beats":{
                "part1":"Time can pass more quickly or more slowly in an RPG than it does in real life, and the pace will shift many times over the course of your story. Just like the prose in a novel, your conversation will glaze over the slow and dull bits, focusing on the ones that are exciting and require more detail. This is why the Mistborn Adventure Game uses a variable time increment called a Beat. \n\n Each Beat represents a unit of time chosen by the Narrator. The shortest a Beat can be is a second and the longest is a century, and every increment in-between is fair game (e.g. one or more seconds, any number of minutes, an hour, a day, a week, and so on). \n\n The length of a Beat may change throughout your story, but it will generally remain the same so long as your conversation lingers on a given part of the story (e.g. so long as your characters remain at a given location, or through an in-character conversation, or until the end of a fight). \n\n Beats give you a framework within which to describe the action. If the Narrator shifts the Beats down to just a few seconds at a time, you know the pressure’s on and everyone has to pay a lot more attention to the little details (this is common in combat, for example). If the Beats move up to one a minute, then you can rest a little easier and lavish detail on each Beat — unless of course you’re in the middle of a foot chase or another situation that demands you keep your descriptions tight and focused.",
                "example":"Brandon: “The Bylerum Boys leave you with a description of the heirloom — it’s a clay case about this big...” He indicates the item’s rough size with his fingers. “Then they clear out, leaving you to your own devices. What’s next?” \n - Ben (Sev): “We need a plan.” \n - Isaac (Damosi): “Let’s see if Gavon has any idea where the case is.” \n - Brandon: “It’s going to take several hours to arrange a meeting with him. Is there anything you’d like to do in the meantime?” \n - Peter: “I’d like to reach out and see if any of my friends have an idea who’s staying at the keep right now, and whether there are any events planned in the next few days.” \n - Emily: “Any chance my bones belong to a Hasting?” \n - Brandon (smiling): “Sorry, no, but hold that thought.” \n - Ben: “I think I’d like to case the keep for a bit. Have I been there before?” \n - Brandon (considering): “Yes, but you didn’t go inside. It was with another Crew. You were the lookout.” \n - Ben: “Maybe with Gavon’s help, I could get a peek this time?” \n - Brandon: “Maybe. Anything else?”",
                "part2":"Most of the time the Narrator probably won’t even have to announce the Beats; the natural flow of the conversation will suggest them when they’re needed. The Narrator didn’t keep track of the Beats during the meeting with the Bylerum Boys, for example, but if he did they probably wouldn’t have been more than a few seconds each. After the meeting they might shift to hours (if everything the Crew plans is similar in scope to contacting Gavon), or to minutes (if the Narrator decides to focus on Sev casing the keep). \n\n Sometimes you’ll need to know the Beats to see how much your character can get done alongside other characters, such as the Narrator’s Villains and Extras. This is true in combat, chases, and most other competitions. It’s also true when you’re working with a time limit, even if other characters aren’t involved. In all these cases time ticks down Beat by Beat, usually with each character given the chance to act once in each Beat. Some actions may take multiple Beats, as your Narrator will explain. \n\n Occasionally your character may “catch a Beat” (meaning he or she can take an extra action in the next Beat), or “lose a Beat” (meaning he or she has to sit the next Beat out, doing nothing at all). These phrases will make more sense as you see them in context elsewhere in the rules."

Long Breathers let players spend Advancements (see page 119), which makes them one of the Narrator’s best tools in controlling the pace of the game. \n\n Now, with Beats and Breathers out of the way, let’s take a closer look at those numbers on your character sheet, how you use those dice you’ve been fiddling with."

All these things can simply be described without fanfare, so you can get on with more Heroic matters. \n\n Every time you roll the dice you also introduce the chance of failure — and potentially change the focus of the story — so making a roll should be an equally big deal.

When you believe one or more Traits may influence the outcome, describe how they're assisting your character's action. Keep it straightforward and relevant to the story ('I scramble under the table, counting on my slight build to conceal me from the thugs' rather than 'I hide'). \n\n If the Narrator agrees, add a die for each Trait approved.",

In this case Brandon anticipated the Crew would investigate House Hasting and has a short list of things in mind already. The best consequence is that they learn all of them. \n\n The worst consequence, on the other hand, isn’t just learning nothing, but word getting back to House Hasting that the Crew is asking questions about the keep.

At an Outcome of 0 Beck learns one detail, and one additional detail is learned for each point of positive Outcome (so two details at Outcome 1, three at Outcome 2, and four at Outcome 3, and all five details at the best possible Outcome of 4). \n\n The negative Outcomes are just as easy. If the worst possible consequence is House Hasting learning about the Crew’s interest, then each point of negative Outcome puts them one step closer to that discovery. The easiest way to scale this is to invert the positive Outcome (a trick you’ll find is often helpful): each point of negative Outcome reveals a fact about the Crew, or better yet, just about Beck (as he’s the one sticking his neck out for the information, and it’s assumed from the game’s conversation that he’s working alone at this point). \n\n Fortunately, Beck succeeded with his roll, so the Crew’s identities are safe... for now",

It gets the other players worried but leaves the story open enough that Brandon can take the failure in another direction later, if needed. \n\n Now let’s say that one of the players suggests that House Hasting knowing about the inquiries might actually work in the Crew’s favor — the Heroes could move while the House leaned on the whistle-blowers for more details. While this might be a reasonable extension of the circumstances, it’s not supported by the fact that Beck’s roll failed, so Brandon would be well within his rights to veto the idea.",

Can the action impact nearby characters or vice versa? \n\n See if you can “decorate” greater Outcomes with little flourishes to help show off how impressive the success is, and look for ways to “tarnish” lesser Outcomes with flavorful slips, missteps, and minor foibles. Remember that Heroes don’t often fail in Scadrial, and when they do the event should absolutely be portrayed as a “moment” — not the worst thing that could possibly happen, of course (unless they scored the worst possible Outcome), but definitely worth taking a breath or two to ramp up the tension and introduce some new obstacles or dangers, maybe even for the whole Crew. \n\n The Narrator’s final description should include just enough detail to keep everyone at the edge of their seats, dying to hear what happens next, but not so much that the group can’t wait for the moment to pass.",

Nothing’s happening there these days, that’s what. Everyone’s cleared out.” \n - Peter (falling into character for the pivotal conversation): “There’s no one there? Why?” \n - Brandon (informant): “Don’t know. Half the keep’s dark, though. It’s like all the nobles decided it was a good time to travel. Strange, though... I hear they’ve hired even more guards than usual.” \n - Peter (Beck): “Really? Any idea why?” \n - Brandon (informant): “No idea. Maybe it’s to protect those guests who arrived last night. They seem important, at least. They’ve got the whole north wing of the keep to themselves.” \n - Peter (Beck): “Guests, eh? Who are they?” \n - Brandon (still acting as the informant) looks nervously to each side, as if worried someone’s watching, and then says, “You’re not going to tell anyone I said any of this, are you?” Before Peter can respond, he jovially adds, “Of course you’re not! Everyone knows you can trust Beck to keep his trap shut.” \n - Peter (Beck): “The guests?” \n - Brandon (informant): “They’re a couple Mistborn from down south. Call themselves the Bylerum Boys.

Even then you may find it helpful to use a few key phrases when switching focus (“Meanwhile, at the...” or “The group at the...”). These should be specific enough that the new point of focus is clear, though with only two points of focus you can usually get away with much looser dialog (“Meanwhile...” or “The others...”). \n\n Screenwriters, novelists, and other storytellers also rely on a variety of details about each location and the actions occurring there, which is another way you can reinforce where the conversation is focused at any given time. Knowing that one part of the conversation is a chase along a canal while another is a fight within a noble house library offers tremendous flexibility with your descriptions, not only letting you immediately set the focus by including just one word (“water” vs. “books,” for example), but also offering many new ways to embellish on the action. This is of course true with any part of the conversation — the more detail you add, the easier descriptions become, and the more invested everyone becomes in the story. \n\n The Narrator should always lead switches of focus unless your group is very adept at handing off the conversational reins, and also accepting and easy-going enough to shrug off any moments of unexpected friction that may develop (if one person talks over another, for example).",

With this in mind, a chase script is prepared that can fit in any part of the city. The first side to three successes wins the Contest (catching the smuggler or evading the characters, respectively). With this structure, the longest the chase might go is seven Beats... \n\n The first Beat is a breakneck run through open terrain: Physique vs. Physique, with Complications ranging from bystanders getting in the way to hitting a slick stretch of road. \n\n The second Beat is a zig-zag through a market square: Wits vs. Wits, with possible Complications including an animal wandering into the character’s path or a muscle cramp from twisting the wrong way. \n\n In the third Beat the smuggler tries to slip into a crowd exiting a building: he uses his Charm vs. the Heroes’ Wits, with his most likely Complication being the crowd recoiling from him, and possibly even calling for help. The Heroes’ Complications might involve a lot more people spilling out of the building, making it more and more difficult to spot their prey. \n\n The fourth Beat finds the smuggler rushing into the building: back to Physique vs. Physique, with the Complications involving various ways the occupants react poorly to the intruders (stepping in their way or attempting to trip them, upending furniture in front of them, etc.). \n\n The fifth Beat spills out the back of the building and into a sea of hung laundry fluttering on lines across a narrow intersection of multiple alleys: it’s the smuggler’s Physique (to gain as much ground as possible) vs. the Heroes’ Wits (to pick up on tiny signs pointing them down the right alley). Complications can involve characters being caught up in laundry and struggling to rip it off them, confusing echoes off the intersection walls, and momentary blindness as the sun peeks out from between high rooftops. \n\n The sixth Beat is long push up steep tower stairs: Spirit vs. Spirit to represent that it’s more about endurance than strength, and Complications being steps shattering underfoot or birds nesting in the tower being spooked by the rushing characters and flying out in front of them. \n\n The seventh and final Beat — if the chase lasts this long — brings the smuggler to the top of the tower, where he’s set up an emergency safe house. If the chase has lasted this long, this Beat’s a tie-breaker and the Narrator can go for broke: instead of more running, the smuggler sets off a trap, collapsing part of the tower wall at the top of the stairs. Unless they win the Beat, the Heroes are swept into the open center of the tower and plummet to the floor with the debris. They each lose 3 Health and the smuggler escapes. \n\n Of course, Powers might be swapped in at any logical point: Steel or Iron replacing Physique at any point when an Allomancer might get as much speed from Pushing or Pulling as merely running, for example, or Electrum in place of Wits, especially in the fifth Beat when the Heroes are forced to choose (and possibly guess) between alleys. \n\n For simplicity’s sake, the Narrator sets each Complication, no matter the flavor, to a 1-die penalty in the following Beat.",

                "part2":"The answers to these questions may seem synonymous but what’s important here are the story implications. A boxing match and a sword duel are both physical fights but the match is far more likely to end with someone unconscious, while the duel may very well end someone’s life. Likewise, slandering a noble’s good name may see him ousted from his position, while convincing the Obligators that he’s been stealing from the Lord Ruler may land him in prison, or worse. \n\n It isn’t important whether Allomancy, Feruchemy, or other powers are being used, though how powers are being used may inform the Narrator’s answers. For example, an Allomantic duel in which two Coinshots are trying to fling the same meat cleaver at each other is clearly a Physical Conflict, with the loser standing to suffer physical injury. Conversely, two Steel Allomancers demonstrating their powers to win a prized spot in a celebrated crew stand to win or lose in a very different way.",
                "example":"Example: With the legwork out of the way, the Nine Eyes Crew launches its scheme with an explosive distraction — a concentrated attack on the Keep Hasting guest rooms where the Bylerum Boys are staying. (Sev’s reconnaissance didn’t reveal the best place to attack, but Beck knows the Bylerums are the keep’s only guests. He’s also pretty sure they’re setting the Crew up, and he plans to preemptively return the favor. Regardless, the attack should keep the keep’s guards busy while the real action goes down elsewhere.) \n\n The distraction is spearheaded by a Mistborn named Koel and a Thug named Thorrow, who’ve worked with Beck before (they’re also run by two new players joining the game in the third session). Carrow and Cordal haven’t seen these two before, which Beck figures is best (no need to tip the Crew’s hand just yet). Besides, a surprise attack by a third party might nudge the Bylerums to reveal their true colors. \n\n Brandon sets up the Conflict: it’s physical (no surprise there), and everyone’s lives are on the line (the Bylerum Boys aren’t likely to pull any punches, nor are the house guards, and Koel and Thorrow would be suicidal to leap into that fray without fully committing). Even so, Beck’s instructions are pretty clear: the goal isn’t necessarily to kill the Bylerums or the guards — it’s just to keep everyone busy and away from the study on the other side of the building.",

It’s easy to get carried away here, letting a single Conflict turn the tide of an entire war, or putting a newcomer in a critical seat of power among the noble houses, but that spoils the drama and excitement of a well-paced story.

Everyone needs to know what they have to do and what they stand to win or lose. \n\n This is also everyone’s opportunity to add minor details to the scene, just as they would with any other description (see page 131). As usual, players may veto anything related to their characters, and the Narrator may veto or approve anything at all. \n\n With a Conflict it’s almost always best for players to keep descriptions to what their characters can see and sense, as the chance of taking unfair advantage of the situation spikes significantly the further a player’s description wanders outside the character’s personal awareness.",

We could catch them by surprise.” \n - Paul: “I suppose I could Burn Pewter and leap up after you.” \n - Brandon (in the interest of keeping the story moving): “Sure. No roll required.” \n - Paul (perking up knowing there’s no chance the dice will end their plan before it even gets started): “Awesome. Let’s do this.” \n - Brandon: “Once inside the keep’s outer wall, the two of you hustle across the grounds.

On both jobs he’s taken with them it seemed like some of their hired hands — regulars by Gaid’s telling — were ready to back out at the first sign of real trouble. \n\n This background is the perfect set-up for an example of Extras acting on their own. Let’s say Paul and Brandon have set this storyline up on the side, and that Brandon controls Gaid and his hired hands as a foil and several Extras, respectively. Gaid wants to see how Thorrow takes to leadership in the group, so he lets the Thug run things on his own for a small job. \n\n At some point Thorrow has to make some tough calls that place some or all of the hired hands in immediate, mortal danger. Do they automatically follow his every order, even though it may lead to one or more of them getting hurt or even killed? Not necessarily. Thorrow’s new to the group, and it’s entirely reasonable that some or even all of the hired hands are nervous about his presence, or even suspicious of his motives. There may be resentment that he was put in charge of them in the first place. Any of these reasons are enough for dissent in the ranks, and Brandon’s well within his rights to credibly portray that in the story by having one or more of the hired hands refuse Thorrow’s orders.",

His Steel is 6 and he has no applicable Traits. The coins are necessary for the action, so they don’t count as Tools (without them the action simply isn’t possible), and Brandon rules that no other Circumstances apply either (Cordal being surprised is covered by the adjusted order in which everyone declared actions). Cordal has 6 Action Dice. \n\n Carrow Bylerum has Physique 4 (boosted to 9 because he’s burning Pewter), and benefits from the “agile tumbler” Trait. Again, the dagger doesn’t so much help his attack as facilitate it, so it doesn’t offer a Tools bonus, but he’s both attacking a character with greater reach and taking a step this round (see page 196), and two adverse conditions cost him a die. Carrow has 9 Action Dice. \n\n The guards are all moving (one toward the hazekillers and the other two through the door and into the room). None of them have to roll, so they gain no Action Dice and will only gain Defense Dice if attacked. \n\n Koel is reacting to Cordal’s Steelpush and then Pushing on her own. The reaction is ignored when gathering Action Dice, so Brandon focuses on her action. She has Steel 4 with no help from Traits or Tools, and she doesn’t benefit from Circumstances either. Koel has 4 Action Dice. \n\n Finally, Thorrow has a whopping 12 Action Dice (6 for Physique, increased to 11 because he’s burning Pewter, and 1 for his “spear fighter” Trait). \n\n Of course, all this is usually determined as each character declares an action.

There’s no Difficulty here — the coins are definitely going somewhere; all that’s in question is where they wind up. \n\n Koel’s attack is a Contest as well (her Steel against the guard’s Physique), but in her case there is a Difficulty as the coins are being shot blind and through the wall.

The Conflict rules are very structured, with characters acting, resolving, and defending in carefully controlled ways, but there’s no reason the description needs to follow suit. You can describe every action and defense as it’s resolved, taking a granular approach to the Conflict’s story, but this is only really helpful if you put the effort in to make each of them memorable and unique.

                    "part4":"Other groups may want to focus only on damage, defining consequences for each successful attack and using those as a backbone for the Conflict’s description. This offers a highly cinematic flavor in which every moment in the spotlight matters and the story naturally escalates from high point to higher point until the Conflict inevitably reaches a zenith and levels out before the next chapter. \n\n Becky (describing the whole first round of the Conflict): “Amid the frenzied chaos of the battle, Thorrow drops Carrow and stabs his spear into the Mistborn’s thigh. The Bylerum’s scream echoes through the guest rooms, loud enough that no one but Koel notices the fight’s first victim...” \n\n Still, other groups may want to keep the conversation going through a Conflict but save the ultimate description for the very end. This offers the greatest forethought, analysis, and control but it can be disorienting for some, as details can and probably will change before you reach a consensus on what actually happens. We call this the “recap method” and it often flows more smoothly if you appoint a storyteller, preferably one with a flair for the dramatic and a sense of what entertains. It’s his or her job to present one unified version of the Conflict’s events, told with as much campfire gusto as possible, to bring everyone back onto the same page and get them psyched up for the next part of the story... \n\n Anyone (as appropriate or inspired): “A fight erupts as Koel and Thorrow land inside the guest room, a few paces away from the Bylerum Boys and a wiry noble with a stern countenance. The noble doesn’t look like a fighter, and he confirms it by ducking for cover under a heavy table as two guards burst in from the hallway. Weapons are brandished and coins fly...” \n\n The storyteller and Narrator don’t have to be one and the same, and with enough interest, the storyteller role can even shift from player to player with each Conflict. The main thing to remember is that no matter who’s telling the story, the veto rules are always in effect (see page 133). This allows the Narrator to keep the overall plot on track and prevents the storyteller from veering into territory any of the other players (or characters) find objectionable. \n\n Another consideration if you’re thinking of rotating the storyteller role: it can result in somewhat varied tone and presentation, as each player has his or her own style and preferences. Some groups enjoy this while others find it pulls them out of the narrative. As with all suggestions here, your group should weigh the options and go with what best suits their strengths and desired flavor of play.",

Even outside respected society the vicious social ladder persists: the skaa have their squabbles; merchants and tradesmen compete for the best customers; and weaving between all these social strata, criminals and rebellious upstarts scheme to get ahead, settle scores, and plant seeds of dissent. \n\n Social Conflicts are about smearing the enemy’s integrity in the eyes of others, which often also has the happy effect of elevating the winner’s position in the process. This makes a social struggle very different than a physical combat or a mind game; here it isn’t just about winning — it’s about the opposition losing, preferably with the biggest audience possible.

Less devoted advocates are easier to impress, but turning them doesn’t wound the target as dearly. While luring the uninitiated to one’s side is always helpful, it’s also a long and arduous path to victory.",

This is a great example of a Social Conflict, and the audience is all of Luthadel, or at least the powerful nobles acting as gatekeepers for entry into the city’s illustrious social scene.",

It’s also reasonable that their Reputation might account for their standing across the whole of the known world, but Brandon finds it much more interesting for the people in various areas to view the Boys differently. This doesn’t mean Brandon has to keep track of separate Reputation scores and attitudes for every city, region, or group. Instead, he defaults to one prevailing attitude about the Boys everywhere and notes variations as they emerge in the story. After this Social Conflict between the Bylerum Boys and members of the Nine Eyes Crew, for example, it’s likely some in Luthadel will view the Bylerum Boys a bit differently than before.",

Of these, Traits have perhaps the most vital impact, as the right qualities can make or break a character in the eyes of the people; it often isn’t just about putting the right face forward but also leveraging strengths when they’re in favor and downplaying them when they’re not. Tools are less critical and often play no role at all, but secrets... Secrets can mean joyous salvation or ultimate downfall. A well-timed revelation can become a propagandist’s artisan brush, painting a character or opponent just the right color at just the right time to turn heads and change minds.",

Given the importance of having just the right audience, many actions taken in a Social Conflict involve gathering observers and arranging slights and revelations that best speak to them. In fact this is an excellent job for the rest of the Crew and a great way to keep the story lively on several fronts in what could otherwise become a one-man (or one-woman) show.",

                "sample":"One reason the Bylerum Boys are visiting Luthadel is to shore up support, and possibly sponsorship, with one or more of the Great Houses. Unbeknownst to them, however, this effort is opposed by two Crew members named Sayna and Damosi, who are seeding doubt and distrust for the Bylerums in the same quarters. This is a great example of a Social Conflict, with an audience of all Luthadel, or at least the powerful nobles acting as gatekeepers for entry into the city’s illustrious social scene.  \n\n The Bylerum Boys do everything together, so Brandon decides to treat them as a single character here, using the highest or lowest of their Reputation scores as appropriate to the situation. Brandon also rules that the Conflict will only directly impact the Bylerums’ standing within the capital city, though he expects fallout may be felt across the Final Empire (Luthadel is the center of everything, after all). \n\n At least at first, the Conflict only involves the Bylerums and the two Crew members (who are working together, and therefore use the best of their rolls). Brandon sets the Beats to “several hours” apiece, which offers enough flexibility for the story to grow organically and allows him to shift the length from Beat to Beat without overly disrupting the perspective. \n\n The first round starts up shortly before the raid on Keep Hasting (detailed in the Physical Conflicts section), and focuses primarily on an intimate gala hosted by House Elariel. Sayna’s alter ego Lady Sabelle has a standing invite to Elariel gatherings, and she brings Damosi along ostensibly as her manservant, though his great knowledge of Luthadel should come in handy as they manipulate the Luthadel luminaries in attendance. Also, Damosi’s never experienced a noble gala like this one before, and he appreciates the additional insight about the upper crust of the Luthadel’s social strata. As a Keeper assigned by the Synod to learn as much as possible about the city, this is an opportunity he simply can’t pass up. \n\n Sayna’s opening salvo involves seemingly “innocent” gossip about the “newcomers staying at Keep Hasting,” and the “dubious things she’s heard about them” in her travels outside the city. She tells anyone who’ll listen that she’s heard they’re “lazy parasites happily riding the coattails of anyone unfortunate enough to associate with them,” and notes that nearly all the Hasting nobles “fled the city rather than spend any time with them.”  \n\n This is straight character assassination and Sayna’s not being coy about it. Brandon decides it’s all about her delivery: her Charm vs. the Bylerums’ Influence. This is true even though the Bylerums aren’t present — their Reputation speaks for itself, which is enough not only to justify a defense roll but to effectively counter-attack if Sayna loses any rolls (tarnishing her Reputation and possibly branding her a troublemaker).  \n\n For simplicity’s sake, Brandon decides the Conflict will unfold like a series of Contests — there are only two sides, and in both cases they’re only producing one Result each. Brandon also rules that revealing the Hasting nobles’ reaction to the Bylerums counts as a Minor Secret, and so any Reputation damage Sayna and Damosi inflict in the first round will increase by 2. \n\n Sayna’s “con woman” Trait applies, and while Brandon decides her tactics are a bit too forward for her to also apply her knack for “disarming innuendo,” he lets her fall back on the fact that she’s “confident.” He also lets her use Zinc instead of Charm on the grounds that while her words will spark suspicions about the Bylerums, her Rioting may fan them into a fire. With a Zinc of 5 and two Traits supporting her effort, Sayna has 7 Action Dice. \n\n Damosi spends the first round among the skaa servants at the gala, making friends and spreading the same rumors. He’s previously stored 12 charges in a Duraluminmind and taps 3 of them to gain 3 dice with his Charm roll, bringing him to 6 Action Dice. \n\n The Bylerums’ Influence is only 4 (they haven’t made very strong inroads anywhere), and since no one knows anything about them, there aren’t any Circumstances to help or hurt their defense. All their Traits focus elsewhere, so they’re stuck with just 4 Action Dice. \n\n Sayna and Damosi resolve their actions first. She rolls two 6’s, two 4’s, one 3, and two 2’s — a Result of 4 with two Nudges, and he rolls one 5, two 3’s, two 2’s, and one 1 — a result of 3 with no Nudges. Brandon rolls for the Bylerums and gets two 4’s, one 2, and one 1 — a Result of 4 with no Nudges. Sayna’s Result is the best between the Heroes, and though her Result ties the Bylerums’ defense, she wins out with Nudges. The Heroes’ efforts are successful, and in the hours leading up to the raid, the nobility (and their servants) are already speaking ill of Carrow and Cordal Bylerum. \n\n The Heroes devote both Nudges to damage (needing to turn the nobility against the Bylerums quickly), which means the Bylerums lose a total of 5 Reputation (base 1, plus 2 for Nudges, plus 2 for the Minor Secret the Heroes revealed). The Bylerums’ full Reputation is 8 (they’re not incredibly charming either), and so this not only brings them to less than half but leaves them with a Grave Burden, which Brandon and the Heroes discuss, settling on “Humiliation.” \n\n As the gala winds down for the night, the raid on Keep Hasting spins up across the city. The Crew’s scheme is off to a fine start."

The shapeshifter is smuggled into the keep by another Crew member, Gavon, who already works there as a steward, and once inside JeHoy assumes the form of a skaa servant woman who was recently murdered to cover up her torrid affair with the keep’s captain of the guard. \n\n (Beck learned of the skaa woman’s death and followed the lead back to her grieving brother, and he promised vengeance for the survivor if he could borrow the dead woman’s bones for a time. Though confused and disgusted, the brother was ultimately won over by Beck’s determination, and he provided the bones that JeHoy now uses to assume the dead woman’s form.) \n\n In the hours leading up to the raid on Keep Hasting, JeHoy periodically appears as the servant girl, though only when no one but the captain of the guard can see her. Beck hopes that the captain will become so preoccupied with visions of his dead lover that he’ll ignore his duties. \n\n This part of the story unfolds as a Mental Conflict between just two characters — JeHoy and the captain of the Keep Hasting guard — with the captain’s mental stability hanging in the balance. \n\n Brandon sets the Beats to an hour apiece, which means the whole of the Conflict will be over before the raid begins. Despite this, none of the players will know exactly what comes of JeHoy’s victory (or loss) until Koel and Thorrow are on the scene. \n\n In the first round, JeHoy appears to the captain in the late afternoon, as he’s drilling the men. She keeps her distance, hovering in a distant doorway but making sure she’s close enough for him to clearly make her out. She pulls away as he approaches, and she’s gone before he can follow. \n\n This is harassment, pitting JeHoy’s Wits of 5 against the captain’s Spirit of 4. JeHoy’s “infiltrator” Trait applies, and Brandon also rules that the risk to the captain is so high if the servant actually lived, that JeHoy gains a Circumstance die as well. JeHoy has 7 Action Dice, while the captain has 4. To keep this simple, Brandon sets this Conflict up as a series of Contests as well. \n\n JeHoy rolls one 5, one 4, three 3’s, and two 1’s — a Result of 3 with no Nudges, and the captain rolls two 5’s and two 2’s — a Result of 5 with no Nudges. The captain wins the first round, dismissing the vision as a trick of the late afternoon sun. JeHoy suffers 1 Willpower damage from discouragement. This drops her from 9 to 8 Willpower — not enough for a Burden. \n\n The second round occurs at dinner, and JeHoy decides it’s time for a bit of a scene. She appears as the servant woman again, this time drawing the captain’s attention as she carries a platter into the kitchen. The Action Dice are the same, and this time JeHoy wins with a Result of 3 with three Nudges. She commits only one Nudge to damage, pouring the other two into eliminating the captain’s Action Dice during the third round, which she hopes will end this once and for all. \n\n The captain’s Willpower drops from 8 to 6, enough to inflict a Serious Burden, which both Brandon and JeHoy agree should manifest as heightened anxiety. The captain rushes into the kitchen, screaming about the woman no one’s seen in days, and the other servants do what they can to avoid him for the rest of the night. \n\n As the third round starts the captain is holed up in his private rooms, drinking more than he should (Brandon decides this is a great way to showcase his lower Action Dice). The captain’s trying to forget the woman he’s been seeing all day but his mind drifts to her anyway... To the winsome smile she would sneak at him when the nobles weren’t looking... To the tiny ashprints her feet would leave as they walked together late at night... And to the locket he gave her days before he had to kill her... The one he left on her body as a final apology for all the pain he’d brought into her life. \n\n The locket sitting on his pillow as he stumbles into his bedroom! \n\n The servant girl’s brother also loaned Beck the locket, and JeHoy has left it for the captain to find as what she hopes will be a masterstroke in her ploy. \n\n Brandon gives her a Tools die, and with the extra die she gets by applying the captain’s new Burden she’s rolling 9 dice this round against the captain’s paltry 2. She gets three 6’s, three 5’s, two 3’s, and one 1 — a Result of 5’s with three Nudges, while the captain gets nothing (one 4 and a 2). JeHoy could spend all three Nudges to inflict 4 Willpower damage, but she only needs 3 for a Grave Burden and has an interesting suggestion for the remaining Nudge. \n\n The captain races out of his rooms, screaming his lover’s name, and"

Money is here as it appears in the books — it’s something some characters have, and many pursue, but it’s ultimately less of a goal or statistic than a driving force in the narrative. Like their literary cousins, the Heroes of your saga are concerned with what they’re doing and the fate of the world around them, not the number of coins in their pockets or how much loot they’ve stashed back at their hideout. \n\n This doesn’t mean money doesn’t exist in our Final Empire — quite the contrary — but the rules keep the details light and focused on the plot, as it should be. When you need to represent characters having extra money, an extra Resources die or two is a good replacement for counting coins. Keep it simple: one die for a minor boon and two for a major windfall (and never more lest money start to dominate and ultimately render rolling irrelevant). The Narrator should also keep expenditures in mind, as any coin in hand will eventually be spent, reducing or eliminating these bonus Resources dice.",

The package contains reams of evidence, some manufactured but most legitimate, showing Carrow and Cordal Bylerum at the center of all the unfortunate business at hand: they wormed their way into the city, lying about their status and what they could offer in exchange for sponsorship from Hasting; they urged Hasting to mobilize troops near Urbain borders; and they even hired the Crew that raided the keep, playing the victim when they were behind the whole affair! \n\n Beck and the Crew have planned this from the outset. It’s the masterstroke of a long and complex plan, and all that remains is to convince the nobility (and the people of Luthadel) that the Bylerums should be held accountable for all of it — everything they did and didn’t do — and that they should receive the full measure of Imperial sanction for their misdeeds. Only then, with Hasting occupied fending off criminals at every turn and the Bylerums on the run, can the Crew rest easy — at least until the next job. \n\n Brandon decides this is an elaborate manipulation of the Imperial system, with a Difficulty of 3. Beck’s the one spearheading the effort, which is why it’s possible — he’s the only member of the Crew with an Influence score high enough to attempt the Challenge (6), and the fact that he’s “known as an upright citizen” means he might actually have a chance to pull this off despite the fact that he’s not present and the Bylerums are still in town and able to defend themselves (two adverse conditions that cost him a die). \n\n Beck rolls 6 dice, getting three 6’s and three 3’s — a Result of 3 with three Nudges! That’s not only enough to condemn the Bylerums within the most powerful noble circles, but also enough to permanently ban them from the capital. An Obligator investigation is launched in the coming days, as Carrow and Cordal flee Luthadel in shame, and soon they’ll have to answer to the rest of their House as to why so many of their contracts are falling through, and so many of their assets are being seized. \n\n Hasting’s troops withdrawn, Beck can return home, where he and the Crew can plan their next great scheme.",

Gone are the red skies, barren lands, and constant ashfalls that blot out the sun, replaced now with blue skies, lush plants, and pleasant weather similar to our own world. Gone are the Lord Ruler, the Steel Ministry, and its Steel Inquisitors, replaced by a government of freely-elected officials, constabulary, and lawkeepers all dedicated to protecting, rather than oppressing, the people. Gone is the systematic repression of technological and intellectual progress, now replaced with thriving industry, scholarship, art, and culture — and all the benefits that come with it. Gone are the brutal social and ethnic divides amongst Scadrial’s inhabitants, who now can intermingle, interact, and intermarry as their lives and love guide them. \n\n Yet despite these changes, there is much that has not changed about this land over the last three centuries. As darkness falls, mist still rises from the streets to cloak those who prowl them in mystery. Men with power still scheme and betray, seeking to line their pockets through the labors of others. A lucky few can still harness the powers of Allomancy or Feruchemy — sometimes both. A great and untamed wilderness surrounds the cities, where men and women still struggle to find a life or make a living. Koloss tribes — though freed from the will of the dark god Ruin — still prowl the remote plains, now living off the land and wandering at the fringes of society rather than invading it. Mysterious shapeshifters known as the Faceless Immortals still inhabit the dreams of children, and the thoughts of those who have seen something beyond the ken of mortals. And secrets are still dangerous, whether they are used as weapons, as protection, or as tools to turn the world upside down.",

After moving Scadrial into a better cosmic location, Harmony was able to do away with many of the natural features the Lord Ruler had created to keep the planet from dying: ashmounts were flattened, the skies and seas were cleared of ash, and hardy brown plants were replaced with lush green vegetation. These changes — though they might seem small — have fundamentally shifted the way modern Scadrians live, work, and grow as a people and a society.",

The Basin is a land of plenty, located much closer to the equator than the Final Empire; it’s adjacent to the sea, where the natural watershed from the mountains provides ample water and fertile soil for farming. The Basin was the nursery for the infant society of the Originators, and the breast which nursed its exceptional recovery and growth. \n\n Amongst the fertile farmland, seventeen cities grow. Chief among them is Elendel, the Cradle of Light, which sits on the shores of the Yomend Sea. Blessed with an industrious population and abundant resources, it forms a hub of trade and commerce for the entire Basin. Other cities have advanced along similar lines: their forms of government vary, but all of them benefit from prosperous trade and rapidly evolving technology. The Irongate River — a massive waterway originating in the Faleast Mountains — cuts the Basin neatly in two, facilitating travel and trade as well as providing plentiful fishing. \n\n Three mountain ranges surround the Basin, forming an almost perfectly circular barrier. The Channeral Range sits in the northwest, the Faleast Range in the northeast, and the Seran Range in the southeast. Two seas, the Yomend and the Lennes, form the Basin’s western border. All three mountain ranges offer abundant mineral resources, and a fair number of mining towns have sprung up among their peaks (along with the occasional trapper or hermit who travels there for the solitude). \n\n Those wishing to journey beyond the mountains have two basic options: the great Northern Gap sits between the Faleast and Channeral ranges, while the wider Ascendant Valley opens up between the Seran ranges and the sea. Both lead into the Roughs beyond the mountains, and feature railway lines into the more civilized corners.",

Rain rarely falls here, and crops only grow through a lot of hard work and careful tending — but for the industrious and unscrupulous, there are fortunes to be found as well. \n\n Out of this rugged landscape, several communities and townships have sprung up, often without law enforcement or any semblance of government. Often, the only law in these hardscrabble communities is “might makes right,” as bandit gangs prey on unwary travelers and justice is doled out with the barrel of a gun. The line between good men and bad is often drawn in the thinnest of terms out in the Roughs, and sometimes it vanishes entirely. But even this imperfect place, dominated by petty desires and the great evils that spring from them, carries the potential for great futures and even greater heroism."

Most importantly, the strict caste system that defined the Final Empire’s society has been erased, replaced by a much more egalitarian class system.

Those who survived the tumultuous years that preceded it emerged to rebuild civilization, based on his Words of Founding. Together, the Originators founded cities, engaged in trade, and established new forms of government to rule their population. \n\n Naturally, conflicts arose between various factions, as personal ambitions and the desire for more territory tested the population’s unity. The fertility of the Basin limited the need to compete for resources, but some power hungry leaders saw the remade world as a chance to start a new empire, while others allowed festering resentments and perceived slights to boil over into open hostility. Conflicts flared throughout the first century of the new era, as growing city-states jockeyed for position and supremacy. \n\n They eventually settled into the system that now stands: cities with stable borders, interlinked in a series of mutually beneficial alliances. Commerce triumphed over territoriality. A complex series of treaties and agreements bound the cities together, creating stability and allowing technological advancement to flourish. By and large, the squabbles and attacks that defined the early years have vanished. \n\n With peace and prosperity came the need to explore this brave new world, particularly the Roughs beyond the great mountain ranges. Most of the hardy pioneers who first ventured there were never heard from again, but gradually more settlers arrived. Towns sprang up, railway lines appeared, and real government began to claim small areas from the gangs and bandits who previously ruled. \n\n Today, Scadrial has settled into a largely stable society, with an acknowledged social order, economy, and territory. Conflict erupts over resources, class strife, and economic disputes from time to time, but for modern citizens, history — and their future — is what they choose to make of it.",

While many famous Houses from the pre-Origin days managed to survive into modern times, their prestige is no longer simply an extension of legal, genetic, and magical superiority. Nor is the power of Allomancy exclusively their birthright — in fact, magical ability is a vital part of all levels of society (see page 156). Though their positions afford them great comfort and means, nobles are subject to the same laws as common folk — the times of tormenting weaker people, or each other, with impunity are over… for the most part. \n\n Despite the necessities of realpolitik, not all nobles are selfish. Many of them understand their obligation to society, with thousands of workers and others of the underclass dependent upon their actions. Many more believe that their station offers opportunities to improve society, and a tradition of patronage for promising artisans, engineers, and craftspeople has become a widespread phenomenon."

This new space for opportunity has allowed those with skill and ambition to raise themselves up, far beyond the dreams of their skaa forbears. \n\n Since the Lord Ruler’s fall, a skilled middle class has arisen, thanks to new educational and vocational opportunities available in the cities. Craftspeople, entrepreneurs, inventors, and merchants have become the engine driving Scadrial’s technological revolution as they hone and expand their craft. At the same time, the freedom of expression enjoyed by clergy, scholars, and artists has allowed them to explore new ways of thinking and build a more progressive and just society. With this prosperity comes wealth and comfort; these innovators make up a new middle class that enjoys the rewards of their hard work in a way never afforded to the skaa. \n\n More importantly, the success of the growing middle class has allowed them to challenge the traditional roles of the nobility. Many city councils now offer seats to the representatives of various trade unions, while some individuals become powerful enough to claim seats on the council through their own influence. Some even more ambitious personalities seek loftier goals, hoping to use their success to found new noble Houses and catapult themselves far beyond their birth. Such aspirations do not go unnoticed by established Houses, and more than one such enthusiastic commoner have found their reputations and livelihoods quickly and brutally under assault by those who seek to maintain the status quo."

Nevertheless, even the most destitute and desperate citizens live lives far richer and safer than those of the skaa who preceded them."

From those meager few, Terris culture has become stronger than it has ever been, now both fully accepted by, and integrated with, everyday society. \n\n The thought of gelded Terrismen living in absolute servitude to the nobility is now a distant and unpleasant memory; today, Terrisfolk ply their trade as scholars, advisors, spiritual guides, and servants — as they have done since the days before the Origin — as well as farmers, craftspeople, artists, politicians, and constables. The influence of Terris culture can be seen everywhere: in popular fashion, in traditions of scholarship and stewardship, and particularly in the spread of Feruchemical abilities in the populace (see Ferrings, page 167). \n\n But this integration is balanced with the Terris desire to retain a distinct ethnic identity; as Scadrial’s oldest surviving culture, some see Terris ways as something they’re responsible for preserving, while others take them as a birthright. The mountains and hills surrounding the Basin are filled with small Terris enclaves, where more insular Terrisfolk choose to keep to the old ways far from the cities. Marriages between Terris and those of non-Terris descent still remain an uncommon occurrence, though the trend is gradually shifting as more and more Terris youth seek adventure and fortune among the greater Scadrian society.",

Those that sheltered with the last vestiges of humanity during the Final Ascension survived to see the rebirth of the world, but mysteriously disappeared shortly thereafter. Many of their fellow Originators thought the kandra might have died off, but there are rumored sightings of these strange creatures even today. Modern folk call these mysterious beings the Faceless Immortals, and they are believed to be servants of Harmony himself. An encounter with a Faceless Immortal is exceedingly rare in the modern day, for they only appear to those who need their assistance most. Those who ignore the Immortals’ divine messages do so at the most dire peril.",
                "koloss":"Perhaps the most dramatic changes to any of Scadrial’s races during the Origin came to the koloss. Most of the koloss hordes the Lord Ruler used as terror troops were slain by Elend during the Final Ascension, but a choice few — including the koloss Human and his horde-mates — sheltered with the rest of the Originators. Harmony made them true-breeding to give them a chance at a more normal life, and freed them of their slavery by Ruin to choose their own destiny. \n\n In the three centuries since, koloss have become an accepted — if not always fully accepted — part of Scadrian society. The koloss now live in tribes, primarily in the Roughs, where they live a far less violent lifestyle than their ancestors. Those born to koloss parents, or with koloss heritage, often have a faint grey or blue cast to their complexion and are known as koloss-blooded. \n\n Most koloss-blooded live their entire lives in the tribes, accepting their iron spikes when they come of age to become “full” koloss, but many others choose to leave their tribes to live amongst humans. Some rare koloss-blooded can even inherit the power of Allomancy or Feruchemy, making for truly terrifying foes…or powerful allies."
            },
            "tech":"Scadrial has made tremendous strides in terms of technology since the times of the Final Empire. Once the Lord Ruler’s restrictions on technology and progress lifted, humanity was once again free to explore science and technologies that could improve their lives and economy. \n\n Money is one of the few things that hasn’t changed much in modern times (save for the fact that atium is now the stuff of legend, much less part of the economy). Most currency is issued from the Central Bank of Elendel, and comes in three denominations: coppers, or minted coins, are the smallest and most common form of currency (much like the Imperial clip); notes, or paper money, are used for larger transactions; and bars, typically made of gold, are the largest denomination. Pure metal bullion, particularly of rare or highly useful metals like Aluminum, Bendalloy, Electrum, or Nicrosil, is also a popular trade commodity. \n\n Modern Scadrial’s technology has advanced to a point very similar to that of Europe or North America in the mid-to-late 19th century. Industrialization is now widespread, and goods can be manufactured on a massive scale. Railways packed with steam-powered locomotives crisscross the land, allowing people and goods to move nearly anywhere quickly and efficiently. Revolvers and repeating rifles are now commonplace, and rotary guns and explosives are changing the face of conflict. \n\n Most cities in the Basin have paved or cobblestone streets, gas lighting, and sometimes even electric power. Horseless carriages and automobiles are new and exciting inventions that herald the promise of a bright future. \n\n The average citizen has reaped the fruits of these advancements. Homes are heated and dry, and the availability of electricity and gas are radically changing the comfort and convenience of life. Most people can travel cheaply and (comparatively) safely whenever they wish, thanks to the prominence of rail travel, and improved trade routes give normal folks greater access to fresh food and valuable trade goods. New inventions such as the phonograph, the typewriter, and the photographic camera continue to improve day-to-day life. Factories have recently moved to automation of many tasks, creating even more skilled jobs and higher-quality products at lower prices for all. \n\n Beyond mundane technologies, magic has also found its place in technology and business. With mass production of goods now common, vital implements such as purified metals and inexpensive metalminds suited for use in Allomancy and Feruchemy have become more widely available. Enterprising engineers have also developed new tools for augmenting Allomantic powers (such as gliding wings for granting Coinshots limited flight), or countering them (such as Aluminum bullets that cannot be Pushed or Pulled, or Aluminum-lined hats that deaden emotional Allomancy).",
            "law":"The end of the Lord Ruler’s iron-fisted reign has had one very palpable downside: the rise of the criminal element. During the days of the Final Empire, thieving crews were often folk heroes whose daring raids on noble Houses and the centers of power served the cause of justice (at least tangentially). But with the absence of a vastly unfair social system, the Steel Ministry, and the ever-watchful eyes of its Obligators, crime has flooded back to fill in the cracks. In the cities, organized gangs battle the law and each other for control of such rackets as metal forgery, robbery, weapons smuggling, and extortion. \n\n In the Roughs, bandit crews sometimes operate like virtual kings, raising armies of goons, capturing mining and industrial operations, and even taking over entire towns. Fortunately, there are men and women willing to oppose thugs no matter where they operate. In the cities, law enforcement is typically the purview of the constabulary, which combines the functions of the old city watch with new and increasingly sophisticated investigative skills. Constables (also known as “conners”) patrol the streets, maintain public order, and respond to crimes and emergencies in progress. \n\n In Elendel and other larger Basin cities, new “consulting investigators” have joined the fight, specializing in applying logic and existing evidence to pinpoint suspects and apprehend them before they can strike again. In the Roughs, justice is administered by the lawkeepers: sheriffs fighting to keep the peace by any means at their disposal. Unlike constables, lawkeepers don’t answer to any central authority: while some stay in one place, most are roving defenders of order, working in conjunction with multiple municipalities to deal with whatever problems may arise. Some less charitable individuals are scarcely more than bounty hunters, perfectly willing to let a community suffer if it can’t scrape together the necessary notes. No matter the particulars of a lawkeeper’s ethics, in the Roughs each is the face of the law — which means they often play judge, jury, and executioner as the need arises.",
            "belief":"During his thousand-year reign, the Lord Ruler went to great lengths to stamp out all forms of religion and faith. Countless beliefs were ruthlessly snuffed out, their practitioners executed, and their holy texts burned. The diligent efforts of Terrisfolk across the globe — acting in secret and often at great risk to their own lives — preserved the tenets of some of these religions, but the rest were lost to the sands of time, casualties of the Lord Ruler’s tyranny. \n\n The events surrounding the Lord Ruler’s demise led to the rise of several new forms of religion, which flourished and spread in the centuries that followed. Today, many of those early faiths constitute the primary forms of worship in the world, practiced by fanatics and secular adherents alike. The Church of the Survivor enshrines the words, deeds, and schemes of Kelsier, the Survivor of Hathsin; it emphasizes self-sufficiency, independent thought, and a reverence for the mists. The Path arose from the teachings of Harmony, and instructs its faithful, Pathians, to simply leave the world a better place than they found it and to regularly reflect on their place in it. Other faithful may cleave to the ancient dogmas of Trellagism, the secretive dark faith Sliverism, or Trellism’s upholding of exceptional people — especially Twinborn.",
            "beasts":"Though the world of The Alloy of Law has changed radically, Harmony did not see fit to wipe any living creature from existence entirely — only to make whole that which wasn’t. For example, one of the greatest “monsters” of the World of Ash, the koloss, are no longer the mindless engines of destruction they once were, and now have something recognizable as a society (see page 259). \n\n Mistwraiths also have a place in the new world, living on the fringes of the Roughs as scavengers and occasionally apex predators. While their terrifying reputation has diminished somewhat along with popular fear of the mists, a feral mistwraith remains a brutal opponent that even the largest gun or most powerful Twinborn will struggle to take down. \n\n Aside from these more exotic beasts of the bygone world, the remade Scadrial is also home to many animals that died off in the Lord Ruler’s world. Mountain cats, bears, predatory birds, snakes, and other dangerous critters present a danger that, while not as memorable as mistwraiths, can easily fell the unwary.",
            "magic":"Magic is a hallmark of Scadrian society; with the dissolution of the Final Empire, those with a talent for the Metallic Arts (also known as metalborn) were able to come out of the shadows and use their gifts without fear. The Originators included Allomancers, Feruchemists, and even Hemalurgic creatures, and they rebuilt their world as one where magic was not only accepted, but harnessed for the greater good of their fledgling society. \n\n But magic has definitely changed in the last 300 years. The Mistborn and Keepers, who could use the full spectrum of Allomancy and Feruchemy respectively, are now a memory, thanks to the interbreeding of Scadrial’s people and dilution of the magical bloodlines. Nearly all metalborn are either Mistings, who can use one Allomantic power, or Ferrings, who can use one Feruchemical power. Some can use both; these rare individuals are known as Twinborn. \n\n The upside of these changes is that the Metallic Arts are now available to people at all levels of society, and are writ large in all walks of life. Many business ventures depend upon Coinshot couriers, Pewter-using laborers, Lurcher bodyguards, Copper-tapping clerical workers, and so on to achieve their goals. Political leaders are always on the lookout for Rioters and Soothers lurking at the edges of campaign rallies and protests, and employ Smokers to protect their own interests. University students seek out Slider study partners to squeeze in a little more practice time before the big exam, Duralumin-tapping salesmen use their powers of connection to close deals, Bronze-burning constables seek out rogue Misting criminals, and Brass-tapping firefighters use their powers to walk through the flames relatively unscathed. The fact that a poor man is as likely as a noble to discover magical talents has provided new opportunity for those willing to use those gifts to raise themselves up and achieve great things, regardless of their birth."

            "intro":"The Elendel Basin is the cradle of civilization in The Alloy of Law, thanks to its fruitful farms, roads and railway lines, and cities from which much of the world’s culture has sprung. It is the Basin that is home to the great metropolis of Elendel, and it is the Basin’s many smaller cities that are home to the industry, scholarship, and innovations that move Scadrial forward.",
            "elendel":{
                "part1":"There’s an old Scadrian saying, known by folk the world over: “If you can’t find it in Elendel, it probably doesn’t exist.” Looking at the Basin’s largest city, it’s not hard to see the truth of it. It was here that the Lord Mistborn first emerged and built his first settlement following the ascent of Harmony, a place to bring his followers together and rebirth civilization anew. Since then, Elendel has striven to honor the Lord Mistborn’s precepts, and grown and prospered from the enlightened policies he set forth three centuries ago. \n\n The city is laid out based on the admonitions of Harmony himself and divided into eight octants, arranged like the spokes of a wheel. At the center of the wheel is the Field of Rebirth: a low hill covered with grass and flowers, home to marble monuments of The Last Emperor and The Ascendant Warrior, as well as a museum on the artifacts, history, and stories of the World of Ash. \n\n From this hub, the eight octants radiate out in all directions. Each octant is separated from the next by numbered canals (save the north and south halves of the city, which are bisected by the Irongate River). These canals lead out from the metropolis to all corners of the Basin, ferrying the never-ending flow of goods that have helped Scadrial thrive. Government buildings form the innermost portion of each octant. From there, housing is a mixture of noble estates, factories, business offices, parks, middle-class neighborhoods, slums, and dedicated areas like the financial district. \n\n The city has no walls — no enemy has ever challenged its sovereignty — and the octants continue to expand outward every year. As Elendel’s city limits grow outward, so too do the buildings grow skyward. Skeletons of new skyscrapers fill the skyline, with new projects appearing seemingly every month. Most of these massive structures belong to large companies or the wealthiest noble Houses, though the City Hall near the Field of Rebirth is a noteworthy and striking exception. \n\n The government of Elendel is formed of a Senate representing all manner of factions that call the city home. Some are scions of influential noble families, others guild leaders, and others representatives directly elected from each of the city’s octants. Corruption and graft come with the territory, of course, but the checks and balances have formed a durable government that actually manages to work for the public good most of the time. Many other Basin cities have adopted governments in the style of Elendel’s, with varying degrees of success. \n\n Despite its age, Elendel remains a work in progress. New ideas and creations appear every day from its universities and company think tanks, coupled with art and cultural innovations that set the standard for all of civilization. But as the metropolis grows more complex, so too do its problems, as patches of rot continue to fester beneath its shining façade.",
                "image":"./assets/Elendel.jpg",
                "part2":"Even as a city of culture and advancement, Elendel has always grappled with a crime problem, particularly in working-class and lower-class districts. The crews of the ancient world have been replaced by vicious street gangs and worse: the first stirrings of organized crime. \n\n The crime issues in the Cradle of Light have led to the creation of the finest and most extensive constabulary in the world. Trained officers patrol the streets nightly, watching for crimes to thwart and innocents to protect. A more sophisticated form of policing is also in its infancy, which utilizes forensic science and other innovations to locate miscreants well after their crimes take place. \n\n Mistings and Ferrings are in high demand among the constabulary — particularly Seekers, Tineyes, Soothers, Archivists, and Steelrunners — in order to better combat crooks whose financing and methods grow more sophisticated by the day.",

Anyone who can’t hack the cutthroat dealing in the city typically leaves for one of the smaller cities in the Basin, or even the Roughs if they’re especially disgusted with big-city politics. While the number of entrepreneurs and hotshot personalities serving as representatives is growing quickly in the city council, the oldest groups still have plenty of sway — particularly noble families. The seats that the Houses hold in the Senate alone give them a leg up on the nouveau riche, and their Noble Houses Collective works tirelessly to ensure labor stays cheap and financial competitors lag behind.",

Steam-powered locomotives can carry more cargo than the largest canal boats, move overland, and reach their destinations in half the time. The relatively cheap cost of a ticket now allows lower- and working-class people to afford to travel anywhere they wish, and first-class railway cars and even private trains threaten to supplant luxury canal cruises as well. \n\n Neither of these innovations has replaced old-fashioned roads, however. Most roads in the Basin and the Roughs are still unpaved and intended for horses and foot traffic, but in the cities, bricks and cobblestones prevail. Even in the most remote areas, metal posts mark the main roads intended for use by traveling Coinshots, still considered the fastest means of delivering news to distant towns.

            "intro":"Most of Scadrial’s population is content to remain in the bountiful Basin, where food and water are plentiful and civilization close by. But those who want something different — whether it’s to live a quieter life, or a more adventurous one, or one free to live by their own law — often brave the mountain ranges to the North to forge their own destinies in the Roughs. \n\n Though the term “The Roughs” is used to refer to any location beyond the mountains that ring the Elendel Basin, the Roughs are typically split into two central sections: the Northern Roughs, which encompasses all territory north of the Channerel and Faleast ranges; and the Southern Roughs, which are the lands southeast of Seran’s Range. The Northern Roughs are the more settled and better explored of the two, thanks to more forgiving mountain passes; when city-folk refer to the Roughs, they’re nearly always talking about the north. Less is known about the Southern Roughs, although there are many rumors and much speculation as to the dark goings-on there; for explorers, the southern regions are the great undiscovered frontier. \n\n The lands of the Roughs are far more harsh than the fertile, flat topography that makes up the lands of the Basin, and suffer from greater extremes of weather, poorer soil quality, and far more difficult terrain — they’re called “The Roughs” for good reason. A visitor from our world might think the Roughs look like the lands of the Old Southwest of late 19th century America: a hard land of rugged beauty, populated by tough, independent folk who live by their own code. From the vast flat plain between Covingtar and Callingfale, to the mesas surrounding True Madil and Isaeuc’s Bend, all the way to the dry mountainous outcrops near Faradana, the Roughs offer plenty of places to find adventure. \n\n Roughs towns vary in population from just a few hundred to as many as a thousand, and range in sophistication from a collection of a few cabins, to gritty mining towns, to cattle towns, to small cities with more than a passing resemblance to Elendel. There’s no central government in the Roughs; rather, each city has more or less adopted a straightforward method of government revolving around city councils and mayorships. While each town has its own set of laws, most hold to the same basic set of principles and rules involving property ownership, regulation of violent crime, and other expected processes necessary for citizens to get along. \n\n In general, Roughs folk are a hardier lot than some of the more genteel people who populate the Basin. People in the Roughs are skilled survivors who work twice as hard as Basin residents to get by. Many have had to face down drought, fire, animal attacks, and bandits at some point in their lives, and had to learn how to hunt, fish, ride a horse, and wield a rifle before they could even read. But given the alternative — a paved-over life in some smoky city, surrounded by strangers and told what to do by a boss or a leader — they wouldn’t have it any other way. \n\n Over the past two decades, the problem of lawlessness in the Roughs has been mitigated somewhat by the rise of the lawkeepers: individuals much like sheriffs of the Old West who work at the behest of communities or their own code to protect the population and uphold the few but important laws and deliver justice to the people.",
            "travel":"The main geographic thoroughfares to the Roughs are natural rivers that converge in Elendel: the 8th–1st Canal in Elendel trickles all the way from its spring deep in the Northern Roughs, through the wide valley between the Channerel and Faleast ranges near Drypost, on down to meet the Irongate River in the city; and the 3rd–4th Canal flows out northwest of the Southern Roughs past Doriel as it heads to the sea. These rivers are vital conduits between the Basin and the Roughs, providing both key shipping lanes for cargo and enough flat land to accommodate large rail spurs necessary to host passenger and commercial train traffic. \n\n Getting to either the Northern or Southern Roughs from Elendel is an arduous journey of at least 200 miles, which means most folks take trains. While train travel is cheap, fast, and mostly safe, the vast isolated areas and lack of law enforcement in the Roughs make train robberies a perpetual hazard. Consequently, trains headed out into the Roughs often employ “private security firms” to guard cargo and passengers and discourage would-be bandits. \n\n Besides the rail lines, simple dirt roads criss-cross the Roughs, connecting larger towns to one another and allowing communities without a dedicated rail line to be reached relatively easily via horse or stagecoaches. Most towns have a coach station near the city center, and several independent drivers and small stagecoach companies deliver passengers, mail, and money from town to town. The same risks of robbery or banditry faced by trains are even higher for stagecoaches, so nearly all drivers have a few guns-for-hire riding shotgun. \n\n However, most of the Roughs are a wilderness frontier, requiring slow overland travel to reach. Even famous settlements like Far Dorest and Farandana lie far from railroad lines and canals. For these communities, isolation is a point of pride, sought by inhabitants who come from other places to escape the stifling confines of “polite society,” the law, or both.",

With so much of the Roughs unsettled and each town’s laws differing from the next, this makes the men and women of the lawkeepers one of the few constants in Roughs society. \n\n Most lawkeepers take responsibility for a geographic area: some larger towns have resident lawkeepers to keep the peace, but just as many are hired by a number of towns and settlements, traveling from place to place as they’re needed, much like the Texas Rangers of the Old West. For the most part, lawkeepers are paid by small stipends from the towns in which they operate or from mercenary work such as protecting a convoy or retrieving stolen property. \n\n Lawkeepers aren’t fully beholden to the city councils as they are in the Basin, but most are honorable individuals who do their best to act in the interests of the folks they’re supposed to protect. Citizens usually afford them respect and cooperation, although some who resent the imposition of rules on their affairs or business can be openly hostile.",

They have to be strategists and team players, capable of working with each other to overcome those odds. They must learn to track their opponents through deep wilderness and to survive with no one else’s help. They have to be skilled negotiators, adept at dealing with city councils in the areas they operate or with criminals when they’re outnumbered. They also must know the law of the towns they protect and how it applies to them (in areas where criminals actually stand trial, that is). \n\n Perhaps most importantly, lawkeepers need to live by a code — one that demands they never give in to or join the criminal element because if they do, the whole system breaks down. However, the line between good and bad in the Roughs grows increasingly blurry, and not all lawkeepers wish to project a sense of moral authority, or couldn’t, even if they wanted to.

Each community typically possesses something relatively valuable — whether it's a mine, food, livestock, a rail station, access to abundant water, or a special craft or specialty — which it can leverage to form relationships with other communities. Barter serves as the foundation of much economic activity between towns, but when shipping items to or from the Basin, Roughs towns typically use coppers, notes, and bars as currency like everyone else. \n\n Outside the towns, most people are subsistence farmers or ranchers, coaxing just enough from the hardened earth to get by and trade their excess for other goods or services in town. In these communities, the value of items such as gold, guns, or Allomantic metals is not measured monetarily but in how well they help individuals survive the next season.

On the west side of the Gap, the Channerel range abruptly ends with a high cliff wall, while fifteen miles to the east, the Faleast range begins. The land in between is mostly flat, gradually ascending into the southern portions of the Northern Roughs. The Northern Gap serves as a vital corridor to the north, accessible by train, stagecoach, horse, or on foot. Despite its scenic beauty, offering views of both the Northern Basin and the Roughs, the bottleneck nature of the Gap makes it treacherous, susceptible to occasional high winds, and a potential target for bandits seeking to exploit the bottleneck for ambushes and raids.",

The locals are extremely proud of the city’s industry and accomplishments, and leave no opportunity to “talk business” untouched. \n\n Like most ranching towns, Covingtar is fairly dirty: its streets are rutted from the traffic of herd animals being driven to market or to the slaughterhouse, and the city has an ever-present animal smell of manure and offal. Whenever folks in Weathering smell an unpleasant odor, they refer to it as a “Covingtar Breeze” — a joke rarely uttered in the company of their rancher neighbors. \n\n Covingtar is also a popular destination for “guns for hire,” looking for work with ranchers, offering protection for their herds from Mistwraiths, predators, and cattle-rustlers.

Garmet (see page 223) is the only town close to the foot of the Sarens, and so is often used as a basecamp for explorers getting ready to head out into the wilds of the Southern Roughs."

These towns are often built by mining companies and operated in squalid conditions, with a mining foreman acting as de facto “mayor,” and company mercenaries serving as “law enforcement.” Life in such towns is miserable, and the only folks who stay are lost souls with nowhere else to go. The workers here toil in the mines by day and consign themselves to company bunks at night — many of them drinking themselves to sleep before rising for a new day of toil. The company store typically controls all the prices, robbing the workers of what little they get to keep, and the law translates to “whatever the company says” — a brutal tyranny by proxy. Lawkeepers hoping to meddle in the affairs of such communities have made some modest reforms (usually by pressuring the companies’ home offices), but typically the companies ensure their affairs are beyond the law’s reach. \n\n The same is not the case in the Seran range, particularly the area around Garmet. As the largest port and only rail line in the area, Garmet holds a great deal of power over local businesses. The city’s labor-friendly government frowns upon the sort of abuses common in other mining towns, and uses the threat of closing off rail access to companies it disagrees with in order to force better conditions for workers. Though life in the Serans’ mining towns is still hard, miners’ councils and similar governing bodies ensure that the residents at least have a chance at a fair shake. \n\n Independent mining camps also exist in all three mountain ranges. Typically, these operations are small teams of a dozen or so individuals working a single mine or claim: however, if the vein is rich enough, that doesn’t mean larger companies won’t make concerted efforts to stamp them out. Consequently, these small camps tend to be stubbornly independent, and meet intruders with blunt warnings and threats of force in order to protect their stake — an opportunity for like-minded or mercenary Crews to find a bit of work outside the Basin"

If a gang is pursued by the law, they can easily vanish into the nooks and crannies of the foothills, where the law is ill-equipped to follow. The Channerels, an extensive cave system near the Northern Gap, has been a popular bandit base for decades. In the more temperate Faleasts range, a hospitable climate has allowed hill gangs to flourish and strike out at foothill towns throughout the north and east. The lawkeepers and constabulary work hard to fend off these raids, to little effect. \n\n Beyond the criminals, corruption is also rife in mining towns. In some cases, the smugglers pay off local mining foremen to look the other way, recruit miners as manpower in exchange for goods and services that make the workers’ lives more bearable, or even arrange for accidents to befall certain odious foremen."

            "deep":"Much of the Roughs, particularly the Southern Roughs, are a pristine wilderness as yet unexplored and unspoiled by humanity. These unexplored regions are sometimes referred to as the 'Deep Roughs' and are as great a source of scientific interest and wild speculation as the alleged lands across the oceans. \n\n Since the nomadic koloss tribes tend to skirt the fringes of human society, many explorers conjecture the Deep Roughs might be host to some sort of 'koloss homeland,' where the blue behemoths make permanent residence far from human reach. If there is a koloss homeland deep in the Roughs, what does it look like? How does koloss society function away from the tribes? What would a koloss city look like? Are the beasts hiding an heretofore unseen written language or culture, and how could humanity benefit from it? For the more paranoid, this theory also casts greater suspicion on the koloss tribes themselves: what do the koloss want? Are the wandering tribes scouting parties or precursors to some larger koloss invasion? Thus far, there are answers to none of these questions, though Elendel's top universities have threatened to mount an expedition from time to time. \n\n Another, even larger mystery of the Deep Roughs is simply how large it is, and what's on the other side. There are many hypotheses on the subject. Some believe the Roughs are simply a desert that becomes less and less hospitable in order to keep mankind inside Harmony's promised lands, much as the Lord Ruler did in his time. Others wonder if the Roughs are merely a natural barrier that conceals a whole different world on the other side — perhaps a paradise filled with great natural and mineral wealth, a new and wondrous ocean, or perhaps another society of humans, waiting to be reunited with the rest of their brothers and sisters. This latter theory has stoked great debate between Harmony's most faithful, such as Pathians and Terris, and the scientific community, for it calls into question the benevolence of their god: why, after all, would Harmony remake the world and save humanity, only to divide them once again? Thus far, the answers have not been forthcoming.",
            "oceans":"Little is known of the land beyond the oceans. Most trading ships keep close to the coastlines, since there’s little motivation to go searching for far-off lands given the cornucopia available in the Elendel Basin. The coastal communities prefer the comparative ease and speed of ship travel to the dangers of the road. Steamers from Bilming and Elendel ply the trade routes regularly, as do ships from several of the smaller communities south along the Sea of Lennes. \n\n Beyond trade, the seas provide a bounty unheard of in the days of the Final Empire, and fishermen are a common sight in coastal waters. As the wealthy grow wealthier, resort communities have sprung up in areas with gentle shorelines, providing accommodations and amusement for guests hoping to enjoy themselves on the seashore. \n\n But the oceans come with their own sort of dangers. Smugglers, often in the guise of legitimate merchants, move all manner of ill-gotten gains in their holds without difficulty. Bolder criminals sometimes use ships to conduct raids on ships at sea, beyond the reach of the law; fortunately, these nautical bandits are thankfully rare and easily driven off by the ships’ crews. \n\n There are only a few brave souls who have traveled farther out to sea, whether as explorers or castaways set adrift in some disaster. Even fewer have returned. Those that have crossed the sea and lived to tell the tale come back with stories of strange islands filled with unusual animals, weird seafaring people who snatch crews in the middle of the night, and other wondrous events. All such stories come with an ominous countenance, and do little to inspire others to take to the sea."

            "early":"The history of the Elendel Basin begins with the Final Ascension, as Harmony remade the world. In an eye-blink, the ashen landscape of the Lord Ruler vanished, replaced by the bountiful land that allowed civilization to flourish. Compared to the previous millennia, the last three centuries have been a golden age — though of course, it hasn’t come without conflict. \n\n When he Ascended and remade the world, Sazed (now called Harmony) drew all of the survivors to a single locale where the heart of the city of Elendel now stands — the Field of Rebirth. With his temporary burst of power, Harmony healed and granted the abilities of a Mistborn to his long-time ally Spook — the last man to hold such power. Harmony then entrusted Spook with a sacred book containing his philosophy and musings, called the Words of Founding, as well as general instructions on how to lead the world’s people into this new age. Spook — along with his friends Breeze and Ham and all who sheltered with them — took this collected wisdom and set out to found a new society. Elendel became their city, Spook became the Lord Mistborn, and the Originators began their new lives. \n\n The Lord Mistborn served for many years as the city’s premier authority, but he was no despot. He took a great deal of inspiration from his departed friend Elend, establishing a democratic council to aid him in making decisions and forming matters of policy, which still rules today as the Elendel Senate. With Harmony’s teachings as a guide, they established the foundations of a just government, adhering to notions of fairness, representation, and enlightenment. Education flourished with the establishment of new schools and the first universities, and the old skaa/noble divisions were abolished in favor of a new, more permeable class structure. \n\n Elendel quickly grew into a thriving urban center under the Lord Mistborn, but there were plenty of people who didn’t wish to live within its physical or social confines. These folk spread out across the Basin, where they formed cities of their own: Doriel, Wyllion, Rashekin, and others. Some of these new cities tried their hand at establishing new, independent kingdoms, and others sought to subjugate the will of others as the powerful had done in the times before. Civil conflicts between Elendel and these rebel fiefs never erupted into outright war, thanks to the sage leadership of folk on both sides, but the first hundred years of the new world were marred by schism and debate about the direction of Scadrial and its people. \n\n Elendel itself developed colonies which soon became cities in their own right, most notably the port city of Bilming and the northern holding of Drypost. Governing these satellite cities proved difficult — Elendel had plenty of issues on its plate to keep it busy — and local councils gradually took over. Remnants of this system remain to this day: Many of the Basin’s current cities base their governments on that of Elendel, and remain beholden by treaty to the great city’s government. However, Elendel maintains a laissez-faire attitude toward these agreements, calling upon its old colonies only in times of great need or desperation. \n\n Eventually, Elendel and the other cities settled their differences, and established strong treaties and trading partnerships to the benefit of all. Despite minor political squabbles, trade flourished and sparked a wave of innovation Scadrial had not seen in over a millennium. The new stability and openness of thought allowed for a culture of innovation to advance knowledge and technology more quickly. Industry came screaming forth, allowing for cheaper mass-produced goods and reliable, well-paying jobs for most. The old canal system, preserved and improved upon by Harmony, was joined by roads and eventually railway lines throughout the Basin, opening up the world to the noble and commoner alike.",
            "class":"While the genetic difference between nobles and commonfolk were erased by Harmony, class remains a strong barrier between the rich and poor. Now, nobles hold power only through money, resources, and connections — not a legal mandate — and it’s possible for someone of low birth to rise to wealth and renown by merit or cunning. A lingering sense of noblesse oblige that the Lord Mistborn instilled in the ruling class encourages the nobility to support charities and social work projects, further reducing tensions between the haves and have-nots. \n\n Even so, social injustice continues to plague the cities. Crime, hunger, and other social ills are still a way of life for many, particularly those in the slums and lower-class neighborhoods. The poor live from paycheck to paycheck, made worse by predatory lending and loansharking by those of means. Guilds and unions have facilitated the rise of a thriving working class, but they too suffer from greed and corruption, and sometimes prey upon the very workers they’re supposed to be helping. The rise of industrialization, assembly line workers, and mass manufactured products has undermined skilled artisans and led to exploitation of workers by factory bosses. The noble Houses continue to scheme against each other as they did under the Lord Ruler, with the common man suffering as a result. \n\n The Lord Mistborn did his best to keep social unrest in check during his reign — preventing reprisals against former nobles even as he expanded rights for the underclass — but as firsthand knowledge of the Lord Ruler’s tyranny faded, new calls for social justice became too great to ignore and proletarian rage has sparked action. In Doriel, workers’ riots burned the center of the city to the ground some fifty years ago, and resentment still stews in some of the poorer quarters. Meanwhile, the criminal underground of Rashekin delights in stirring up the working class as a way of striking back at the city’s despotic ruler. Cities like Elendel do better, largely by allowing guilds and other working-class representatives to share political power. But even there, underclass resentment still bubbles over from time to time, and the ills that plague them show no signs of abating anytime soon.",
            "beyond":"Exploration of the Roughs began when the Lord Mistborn still sat on his throne. He sent scouts over the border mountains to see what they could find. They reported nothing but empty wilderness, bereft of human life and holding danger at every turn. Despite this initial disappointment, brave explorers continued to push past the borders in search of the unknown, particularly Ferrings who could use their powers to mitigate the harsh conditions there. \n\n The search lasted for decades, until in the last days of the Lord Mistborn’s rule, when reports of rich new mineral deposits in the outer lands trickled back to Elendel. The lure of gold, metals suitable for use in the Metallic Arts, and even bauxite (a source of aluminum) began drawing prospectors and entrepreneurs hoping to strike it rich. Many of these dreamers perished in their rush into the Roughs, but many more brought back great wealth…which in turn brought companies to exploit the wealth and criminals hoping to steal what others had earned. \n\n Criminals and fugitives soon began to travel to the Roughs in hopes of avoiding the law, and they were followed soon after by religious outsiders, hermits, and those who simply had enough of life in the Basin. Their existences in the wilderness were brutish, harsh, and often short — a dog-eat-dog battle for survival where the law of the strong prevailed. Many attempts at settling failed, and lawlessness remained the order of the day. But slowly, over the course of nearly 150 years, civilization began to take hold. \n\n Some settlements tried to impose laws in the traditional ways, but eventually it was the rise of the lawkeepers that brought a semblance of order to the chaos of the Roughs. The first lawkeepers refused to surrender their concepts of morality and justice to the wilderness, and they enforced these beliefs with conviction, guns, and metals. Many of them came from the ranks of religious settlers, bound by their faith and determined to do right no matter what the costs. Others started down the path when they had to take up arms to defend what was theirs, while still others were at first mercenaries in the employ of mining companies hoping to exploit the Roughs’ mineral wealth. \n\n In the wake of the lawkeepers’ efforts, tiny settlements slowly grew into respectable towns. At first, they clung close to the region’s few rivers and water sources, but others sprung up farther out — bastions of safety within the wilderness. The first railway spur from Drypost to True Madil was completed twelve years ago, followed quickly by expanded lines to Callingfale and Weathering, with a new extension planned for Isaeuc’s Bend in the next few years."

            "intro":"Religion in Scadrial has a complex history, both ancient and relatively new. It's ancient because during the Lord Ruler’s reign, all religion was stamped out for 1000 years; and relatively new because religion's modern incarnations all arose at more or less the same time, after his fall. \n\n Rebuilding spiritual belief has not been easy for humanity: followers of older faiths had to piece together their tenets from forgotten memories of long-dead civilizations, while those adherent to newer religions had to assemble their philosophies from scratch. Religious groups that succeeded in finding their identity then faced the challenge of finding and retaining new followers, exacerbated by a millennium of religious suppression. These young faiths often struggled to take root, and while many failed, the seeds of belief are resilient — and have taken hold. \n\n Scadrian beliefs have a slightly different tone than those of our world. There are no wars over religion, no purging crusades or notions of smiting unbelievers. This world experienced enough of those traumas under the Lord Ruler, and most believers see divergent beliefs — and the freedom to express them — as proof his tyranny has vanished forever. \n\n Yet religions compete in other ways, like rival businesses trying to dominate the market. In the early days after the Lord Ruler’s fall, a preacher or prophet might arrive in a new town with the intent of converting followers, only to find representatives of another faith already there. These competitions for the hearts and minds of the faithful ranged from races to secure donations from wealthy followers, struggles to claim real estate for worship centers, and rallies to bring worshipers to their banner. There was no direct violence, but some of these contests grew contentious enough that rival preachers and their faithful took their convictions to the streets in minor scuffles. \n\n Today, a handful of prominent faiths have claimed their share of followers, with numerous smaller cults and splinter groups on the fringes. The major contemporary faiths — The Church of the Survivor, The Path, and Sliverism — treat each other with grudging respect, their rivalry limited to snippy dinner conversations and the odd heated debate at a local university. Most of their clergies’ time is spent tending to their flocks, pursuing charitable works, and refining the merits of their various philosophies. \n\n Smaller cults (such as Trellism or Larstaism), or more extreme or fundamentalist offshoots of larger faiths, lack such luxuries. Many of these offshoot faiths retreat to the Roughs, where they can establish their own homesteads and live as they choose, or practice a “purer” version of their chosen philosophy far from the interference of their more moderate brothers and sisters. Hundreds of these tiny religious communes and compounds dot the Roughs, happy in their isolation, and those seeking solace at their gates may discover them to be no more welcoming than the howling wilderness. \n\n Three organized faiths dominate spiritual life in the Basin, with a few other fringe beliefs gaining followers rapidly.

Kelsier’s words became a rallying cry in the last days of the Final Empire, and a call to revolution against the tyranny of the system. Those that believed most deeply in Kelsier’s resurrection founded a cult around the Survivor, and in turn rallied around Kelsier’s pupil, Vin, as his spiritual Lady Heir. \n\n The modern Church of the Survivor holds to the traditions set forth three centuries before, with a dogma patterned after Kelsier’s beliefs and actions.

Above the witnesses are the “pillars,” who coordinate the Church’s actions for an entire city. A Council of Pillars meets every year in Elendel to discuss matters of importance and to assign key roles. \n\n The use of authority in the organized Survivorist church is a matter of some debate. Those who hold the reins argue the needs of a large and popular religious organization necessitate the centralization of power, while their detractors argue their prophet distrusted instruments of power and admonished his followers to think for themselves. While most of the discussion remains academic, the biggest political schism among the Survivorists arises between those who feel the Church needs to rein in its power and those who believe that they can only achieve Kelsier’s dream by exercising their growing authority and social clout to the fullest.",

Faithful often wear Survivorist spears around their necks or pinned to their clothing, while larger spears are used in Church ceremonies. The spear must always be wooden — a sign of Kelsier’s devotion to the common man and the faith he placed in their strength. \n\n Scars, like those the Survivor wore on his arms, also show devotion to the Church. Ritual scarification is one of the faithful’s oldest traditions, and while the practice is less popular than it once was, crisscrossing forearm scars are a telltale sign of the devout Survivorist. Even Survivorists who don’t deliberately scar themselves make no effort to cover up scars they got in other ways, for scars are the surest sign of survival.",

Before his Final Ascension, Harmony was known as Sazed, the Terrisman scholar who helped Kelsier overthrow the Lord Ruler, guided Kelsier’s friends and followers in the subsequent battle against Ruin, and absorbed the power of both Ruin and Preservation to become a god. His followers, known as Pathians, observe Harmony’s teachings in the hope of attaining enlightenment. \n\n Like Survivorism, Pathism is a highly individualistic faith. However, the Path contains no organization per se, only teachings which can be transcribed in a few easy-to-carry pamphlets. Some accuse the Path of being “faith for the faithless,” but Pathians usually just shrug at such accusations, claiming those detractors wouldn’t understand. \n\n The Path’s formal teachings come from The Book of the Path, a collection originally gathered by the Lord Mistborn from Harmony himself. Like its alleged writer, the book doesn’t contain many orders, but mostly observations and musings — questions without answers, and facts presented without embellishment. Those Pathians who read the book (which is far from all of them) embrace the open-ended and confounding nature of the book whole-heartedly, much to the bafflement of others.",
                "belief":"Pathian beliefs are can be summed up in a single sentence: do more good than harm. How and where that good is done depends on the individual Pathian, but the results must be tangible and concrete. There’s no worship of or prayer to Harmony — doing good work in the world is worship. \n\n Beyond good actions, Pathians merely need to meditate fifteen minutes each day on their actions and place in the universe. One’s faith depends greatly upon her personal strength and ability to evaluate herself honestly, for without clarity of perception, the Path cannot be seen. \n\n Pathians’ vague tenets often confound and irritate those who don’t follow the Path. Since each individual must decide what constitutes “good,” their ethics may seem malleable in the face of new events or circumstances. One Pathian may cleave to views that another Pathian can’t abide by, leading outsiders to consider the Path useless or corrupt. However, Pathians themselves see the wisdom in their ethics, for the Path promotes knowledge of the self, which in turn promotes wisdom and understanding. Humanity is a diverse — and at times contradictory — species, and only by acknowledging those differences and allowing each soul to find his or her own path to wisdom can faith be productive.",
                "organization":"Not surprisingly, the Path lacks formal organization or places of worship. Anyone can be a Pathian, and Pathians can worship anywhere they wish. There’s no conversion or initiation, only a personal decision that the practitioner resolves to abide by. \n\n Some Pathians keep monasteries in the mountains and the Roughs, devoting their lives to meditation and creation. These monasteries consist of anywhere from a handful to a few hundred monks, and are self-maintained and beholden to no higher authority. Many who come to join or study at these monasteries believe they have committed great harm in their lives, and seek to separate themselves from the world to avoid compounding that harm. During their time at a monastery, monastic Pathians often focus on mastering a skill or talent, such as a craft, histories, architecture, or even machines that can improve the world. Members may come and go as they will, and travelers are welcome provided they don’t disturb the monks’ introspection. \n\n However, the vast majority of Pathians see no benefit to living cloistered lives. Rather, they choose to engage directly with the world’s ills, hoping to make things better through their actions. Some work in law enforcement or in charitable organizations; others serve in menial positions, hoping to do what good they can. No matter their choice, all these Pathians work to improve humanity’s lot, even if in small ways. Their actions help them understand the truth: that to know oneself is to know Harmony, and to understand others is to see that all life has a common purpose. That is the Path — and anyone can walk it.",

Every Pathian wears a metal earring while praying, typically stamped with the rings of the Path, which is said to increase the wearer’s connection to Harmony. Duralumin, the Feruchemical metal of connection, is frequently used for these earrings, though its use is entirely symbolic for most Pathians.",

Others passed secrets of Hemalurgy from parents to children, or told stories of the living god who held the entire world in his thrall. As the years passed, stories became scripture, and lessons became tenets. Gradually, a new religion formed, in the strictest secrecy.

The commoner and the unbeliever will fall back under the yoke of slavery, beholden to the whims of the Lord Ruler’s chosen few. \n\n The figure of Ironeyes also holds a prominent place in Sliverist belief, for he is the last of the Lord Ruler’s servants and the embodiment of his will in the mortal world. This reverence of Ironeyes is so prominent that it is one of the few tenets of Sliverism that’s widely known outside the tight-knit circle of Sliverist cultists. Many of the leaders of the faithful claim to be in contact with Ironeyes, delivering orders that Sliverist cells carry out to the letter even when those acts are treasonous, violent, or worse. Whether such orders actually come from Ironeyes or merely represent the whims of ambitious leaders is unknown, but they always further their ambitions in some way: subtly extending their influence or undermining those who stand in their way. \n\n The tenets of Sliverist beliefs are quite straightforward, based around the need to remain hidden and the fervent protection of the Lord Ruler’s legacy:",

These stem from the noble families who originally kept their loyalty to the Lord Ruler, although most now include any Sliverist in a given area, regardless of genetic ties. \n\n Grandparents — the senior-most members who form policy and dictate the cult’s actions — serve as the leaders of a given cell. The chief lieutenants of the Grandparents are Parents, referred to as “Fathers” or “Mothers,” while the lieutenants of other cells are referred to as “Aunts” or “Uncles.” The Parents act as the middle managers, charged with carrying out specific tasks under the Grandparents’ guidance. The rank and file cult members are “Sisters” or “Brothers,” who follow the orders of their superiors and usually do most of the actual work. These titles have nothing to do with age or station: it’s not uncommon to see Grandparents in their twenties overseeing Brothers well into middle age. \n\n The Sliverists’ focus on families isn’t entirely metaphorical. Many Sliverists concentrate on bringing their blood relations into the fold before they search for others, and it’s common for Sliverists to refuse to marry anyone who isn’t part of the cult. \n\n Sliverists congregate anywhere they consider safe: empty warehouses, abandoned basements, and false storefronts which deter casual visitors. In a few cases, they meet in a private club or the manor house of some noble family, but such instances are rare. Some cities have laws forbidding the public practice of Sliverism, though influential Sliverist noble families in Elendel are well known. Consequently, Sliverists have learned to move with caution lest they draw the unwanted attention of the authorities. \n\n Sliverist rites tend to be closer to a political conspiracy than they are to an evil cult ritual. They discuss the business of the day, plan actions against those who oppose their ideal order, and discuss the wishes of Ironeyes. Grandparents lead the debates, dictating orders and allowing others to speak at appropriate times. There is no formal lexicon for worship — only a statement of the cult’s beliefs and a pledge from each member to fund their cell’s efforts. \n\n As life was cheap in the Lord Ruler’s day, Sliverists hold the lives of their enemies in low regard. For most, this just means adopting a callous attitude, but a few more…zealous adherents have extended their disdain into violence and sometimes even murder. A few of the more canny police clerks have begun to pick up on these more extreme practitioners, which may spell trouble for the Sliverists in the future.",

Some remnants of their culture survived, thanks to the efforts of the Terris Keepers, and the Trelagists’ knowledge of astronomy that helped Harmony set the planet aright and end the terrible ashfall during his Final Ascension. \n\n Trelagists were stargazers who believed the stars were the thousand eyes of their god, Trell, who watched over them and sent signs through the evening sky. But Trell’s brother Nalt, the sun, grew jealous of Trell’s worshippers and sought to block them out with his single angry eye. At daybreak, Nalt cast down Trell, and every dusk marked Trell’s ultimate victory over Nalt’s vengefulness and anger. \n\n Trelagists believed that spiritual truth is found among the stars, and that their movements hold the key to the universe. By studying their movements and alignment, one could divine the scheme of the universe and thus the mind of Trell. Daylight — the light of Nalt’s burning eye — is profane, for it severs mankind’s connection to Trell, and thus true enlightenment. \n\n Such beliefs are literally antiquated in the present day, and most believe Trelagism to be extinct for all intents and purposes. However, there are those who still claim to be followers of Trell and practice a stranger, more extreme religion, based only very loosely on the original Trelagist legends (followers like Miles Dagouter — see page 277). These Trellists claim that Trell created mankind, and that Twinborn are his superior creatures, destined to rule all others.

The only member of the Set identified in The Alloy of Law is Edwarn Ladrian, a.k.a. Mr. Suit,” former head of the powerful Ladrian noble family and uncle to Waxillium Ladrian (see pages 281 and 265). \n\n The motivations of the Set differ from individual to individual, but the members all agree on one thing: restoring noble rule is a matter of pride, a matter of honor, and ultimately, a matter of power and ultimate control. Their goals — a world where the natural inheritors of power and authority live as gods among men — is worth any loss of propriety or moral integrity, an objective that transcends “morality.” Set members believe themselves to be the heralds of a new age, bringing the order of ancient times to bear against the chaos that has infected the modern world. \n\n If one had to define the Set in a single word, it would be “subtle.” Their plot to recreate the Mistborn of old will literally take generations to bear fruit. However, the Set are both patient and very well funded, with the resources to wait as many generations as it takes to see it through. So long as they end up on top, time is simply another, relatively minor, cost of absolute power. \n\n What the Set cannot afford is for their identity to be revealed before all the pieces are set in place, making secrecy their top priority. As a result, Set members almost always operate through intermediaries, whether they are trusted operatives, member–owned organizations, or unwitting pawns (much as the Vanishers used by Mr. Suit in The Alloy of Law). However, each of these resources’ value is nothing when compared to the secrecy of the Set itself, so when an operative is captured, the Set silences her; when a key asset wavers, they abandon him; or when an important facility is exposed, they simply walk away. No expense is too high if it ensures the continuation of the conspiracy. \n\n In recent times, many Set members have developed a growing interest in gathering lost knowledge from the World of Ash or before, and some members may even have ties to the Trellist faith, oddball cultists, and other fringe groups.

Koloss are still creatures of immense strength and skill at arms, wielding massive chopping blades as long as a man is tall. They still sometimes conduct raids of human settlements (though those raids are not mindless orgies of destruction, but targeted attacks for defense or to capture necessities for their own use). And they still can be affected and controlled via emotional Allomancy (though it is much more difficult — see page 163). However, unlike the koloss of the Lord Ruler’s time, modern koloss have developed their own tribal culture — one that not only values martial prowess, but also personal honor, craftsmanship, and the natural world. \n\n Harmony’s absorption of the god Ruin freed the koloss from the madness and mindless rages their ancestors suffered from, allowing them to create for themselves a functioning society. The koloss warriors that most humans see are but a small part of the actual tribes: Elders, craftspersons, matrons, and children are also to be found, far from the sight of normal people. Those who live amongst these koloss soon discover they have their own language; their own codes of conduct in peace and war; great skill in the arts of tattooing, leatherwork, and smithing; and spiritual rituals, sacred places, and taboos (including a vow not to harm the Terris). These tribes are nomadic, like the koloss hordes of old, following the direction of an elected chief and revering the ancients and their wisdom. \n\n Another lesser–known fact is that many humans who are fed up with “civilized” society seek out and join the koloss tribes. Any human wishing to do so must survive the same trials that all young koloss-blooded do to earn their spikes (see page 145) — no mean feat for an average human — but those that prove themselves worthy are welcomed by the tribe without further reservation. Some believe it is through these converted humans that the koloss came to develop Allomantic and Feruchemical ability (see page 149). \n\n One of the koloss’ greatest secrets, however, is that their numbers are slowly dwindling. Much like in the rest of Scadrial, the fall of the old world meant the loss of knowledge of Hemalurgy, and with it the knowledge of how to create the Iron spikes essential for the transformation to full koloss. This truth is the reason the tribes force the young koloss-blooded to compete for their spikes, for there are simply not enough to propagate their species. Consequently, koloss will go to great lengths to recover bodies of fallen tribemates and warriors, for each carries within him or her the future of both their tribe and their race."

Once, he was a man named Marsh, brother to the Survivor at the end of the Final Empire, who sacrificed his humanity to see his brother and friends triumph. He saw his soul and his world nearly consumed by the evil god Ruin. And he was saved by its new god Harmony. \n\n Today, Ironeyes still walks the earth, the last Steel Inquisitor, ancient and powerful, using a lost ancient metal to keep himself alive. He appears to folk seemingly out of the blue, delivering cryptic messages to those who need them. Ironeyes is often blamed for unexplained deaths or large-scale catastrophes, but he isn’t actually involved with any such thing: His motivations may be mysterious, but those who have encountered Ironeyes believe that he is in service to Harmony. \n\n What Ironeyes does have is a trove of lost knowledge unknown to anyone else in the modern day: the secrets of the Final Empire. As a former Steel Inquisitor, he knows the truth of Hemalurgy and its practice, how to control koloss and kandra, and the traits and properties of Atium. Even more valuable are the Atium beads in Ironeyes’ possession — not only are they the last Atium to survive from the World of Ash, they are the secret of his immortality (thanks to Compounding — see page 190)."

They once lived under Contract to the nobility as spies, but now they live in service to Harmony, bringing his word to the right ears. \n\n Like all the rest of Scadrial’s sapient races, the kandra were restored by Harmony during the Origin, gaining freedom from the influence of Ruin, effective immortality, and the free will they never really had. However, this rebirth came at a heavy price — the ability to reproduce. In gratitude, the kandra transferred the Contract which they held with the Lord Ruler to the true Hero of Ages. The Faceless Immortals take no other contracts or serve any other master — only Harmony, for whom they now act as eyes, ears, and hands in the mortal world. \n\n The Faceless Immortals operate under a different set of rules with Harmony than they did with the Lord Ruler. First and foremost, each Faceless Immortal is strictly forbidden from revealing his or her true identity to anyone directly; their role is observation, not intervention, and their messages are guidance, not directives. Secondly, Faceless Immortals are forbidden from killing under any circumstances, particularly other kandra. Gone are the fancy True Bodies of old; now, all kandra live in animal forms, though they often take the forms of departed humans when needed. Finally, Faceless Immortals must carry out Harmony’s orders, whenever and wherever they are given — an edict none dare defy, for Harmony is the kandra’s prophesied Hero of Ages they had waited over a thousand years to find."

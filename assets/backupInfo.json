First, the amount of damage dealt by an explosion is set, based on how close a character is to the center of the explosion (or the target of the explosive attack). Explosive damage is expressed as 2 values: an explosion’s primary damage is the amount of damage characters closer to the center suffer, while its secondary damage is the amount suffered by characters further away. Each number is followed by a note indicating at what Range from the target the primary and secondary damage are inflicted. \n\n Characters caught in the area of an explosion may attempt to escape damage by making a Physique roll, reducing the damage suffered by the Result, to a minimum of 0 (e.g., a Result of 3 on the Physique roll reduces the damage suffered by 3). During a Conflict, this roll is considered a Reaction and used in place of the normal Defense roll (you may add Action or Defense Dice to this pool if you’d like, though you may not roll more than 10 dice, as usual).
